How to Write a Formal Grievance Letter
This page last updated 6.6.25
My wife Amy and I are employment consultants with 26 years combined experience. Over the last decade Amy and I have helped
thousands of clients
with internal employment disputes covering bullying, harassment, discrimination, unfair dismissal, suspension from work, unfair capability, unfair disciplinary, being put on a performance improvement plan, being made redundant, blowing the whistle, work-related stress, sickness absence, pay, disputes with occupational health, and unfair workplace investigations.
Amy & I know firsthand the stress, anxiety, and distress, which you feel caused by work-related stress, not least because both Amy and I took our own employers to the employment tribunal for sex and disability discrimination, harassment, unlawful victimisation and detrimental treatment for blowing the whistle. For the avoidance of doubt, we only help employees, NOT employers.
Amy and I can assist you in obviating the common mistakes, which we often see employees make when writing a letter of grievance.
