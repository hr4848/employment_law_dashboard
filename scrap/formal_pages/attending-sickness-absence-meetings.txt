Attending Sickness Absence Meetings
Keeping in Touch During Absence – Attending Sickness Absence Meetings:
Are you nervous about attending a sickness absence meeting with your employer?
Do you want to know your employment rights UK when asked to attend a sickness absence meeting while on sick leave?
Read on:
My wife Amy & I
are employment consultants with 26 years combined experience helping employees like you.
Question – Do I have to attend a sickness absence meeting?
Even if you are signed off from work as ‘unfit to work’ by your GP, then yes, you will still likely have to [
consult
] with your employer about your sickness absence from work. However, that does not necessarily mean that you have to actually attend a sickness absence meeting.
In the alternative to attending a sickness absence meeting with your employer, we suggest you ask your employer to undertake the sickness absence process via written form. Ask your employer to email you a list of questions, which your employer wants to ask you regarding your sickness absence from work. This will obviate the need to actually attend a sickness absence meeting in person or via video link. We have covered this topic in further detail down on down this webpage
Question – Sickness Absence Review Meeting Questions?
When attending the sickness absence meeting, the employer will want to know when you will be returning to work. Your answer to this question is that you will be guided by your doctor or GP. Put shortly, your GP is best placed to know when you are fit to return to work, and tell your employer that you will be guided by your GP regarding your fitness to return to work.
You may also be asked as part of the sickness absence review meeting questions what your employer can do to get you back to work. This is a loaded question, which puts the onus on you to answer. To this end, we suggest honesty is the best policy and you inform your employer what the barriers are, which prevents your return to work.
The barriers which prevent your return to work may include the following:
Bullying and harassment
in the workplace by colleagues, your manager or supervisor.
Failure to have put in place
reasonable adjustments
to accommodate a
disability
.
Sexual harassment
.
Micro-management.
Unachievable targets.
Performance Improvement Plan
.
Toxic working environment
.
Unfair disciplinary process
.
Unfair treatment at work
.
Failure to observe a
statutory duty of care
for your health, safety, and welfare at work.
Failure to undertake
risk assessment
.
All the above are very likely to be barriers to your return to work.
Sickness Absence Work-Related Stress:
If you are signed off from work as unfit to work with work-related stress, chances are your employer will want to meet with you to discuss what is causing your stress at work. Amy & I suggest that if your employer contacts you to attend a sickness absence meeting to discuss your work-related stressors, that you raise a grievance letter to outline the ‘root causation’ of your stress. By outlining the cause of your stress in a grievance letter you will:
Slow the sickness absence process down.
Informing your employer of the barriers, which prevents your return to work.
Raising a Grievance Letter for Work-Related Stress:
By raising a grievance letter for work-related stress, you are letting your employer know what has happened at work, which has ultimately led to your sickness absence from work. You can’t reasonably be expected to return to work if you are currently signed off from work with work-related stress. Put shortly, you can argue that returning to work without resolving the cause of your work-related stress, will only exacerbate your work-related stressors even further. As such, it is likely that your employer will put the sickness absence meeting on hold. The grievance procedures will then take priority.
By raising a grievance letter for work-related stress, you can outline within your grievance letter what it is at work, which is causing your work-related stress, and furthermore, what your employer has to put in place so that you can return to work. This is logical.
By outlining your complaints in a grievance letter about the triggers for your stress at work you are providing your employer with the opportunity via the grievance procedures to both address (and remove) the problems at work, which are causing your work-related stress. See
Donelien v Liberata UK Ltd
UKEAT/0297/14/JOJ at paragraph 34:
“The real cause of the Claimant’s problems was workplace stress, producing adverse health effects, which could be remedied not by any medical treatment but only by changing the workplace in a way in which the employer had decided not to do, though the employee would wish, so that as long as the employer was determined to resist any change, the adverse health effects on the employee would be likely to continue.”
Thus, by identifying within your grievance letter what the cause of your work-related stressors are, you are giving your employer a reasonable opportunity to put things right so that you can return to work. This can obviate the sickness absence meeting because your employer is then aware of what it needs to do to get you back to work.
Work-Related Stress Anxiety and Depression:
More often than not my wife Amy & I see that work-related stress has triggered anxiety, ruminating thoughts, sleep deprivation, and depression.
In fact, in the case authority of
Donelien v Liberata UK Ltd
UKEAT/0297/14/JOJ, The Employment Appeal Tribunal held that “stress” is synonymous with anxiety, depression, and panic at paragraph 19:
“Although “stress” is probably better considered as a potential cause of some cases of illness, and is not and cannot sensibly be called an illness on its own, it is common experience that the word is used as a useful label to attach to symptoms which arise from such pressures in those cases, generally though not exclusively being related to diagnoses such as anxiety, depression and panic.”
Thus, if you are signed off from work by your GP with ‘work-related stress’, it is fair comment to say that on the balance of probabilities, your employer knows that you are suffering from ‘anxiety / depression’. This is called ‘constructive knowledge’.
Question – What to say in a Sickness Absence Attendance Meeting?
If you are suffering from anxiety / depression, then make sure that you say so within your grievance letter
before
attending a sickness absence meeting. This way, you can alert your employer to the fact that it needs to make reasonable adjustments for your return to work, and furthermore, for the sickness absence meeting too.
Question – What to say in an attendance meeting as an employee:
We suggest you outline what has happened at work which has led to your sickness absence from work. You need to outline the ‘links’ between your sickness absence from work, and what happened at work which made you ill in the first place.
It is incumbent upon you to outline this information in
writing
in advance of attending the sickness absence meeting. Outlining in
writing
the ‘link’ between your sickness absence from work and the triggers for your sickness absence from work, will automatically trigger your employer’s grievance procedures. For the avoidance of doubt, any complaint in writing is a ‘grievance’ as held in the authority of
Shergold
.
Anxiety / Depression Sickness Absence Meeting:
If you are feeling nervous about attending a sickness absence meeting and you are diagnosed with anxiety or depression, you can ask your employer as a ‘reasonable adjustment’ to undertake the sickness absence meeting via email.
Put shortly, in the alternative to attending a sickness absence meeting in person or via video link, ask your employer to email you a list of questions, which your employer wants to ask you, and inform your employer that you will email them your responses. If your employer fails to agree to this ‘
reasonable adjustment
’ in the alternative to attending a sickness absence meeting, let us know –
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or 07775943414 during business hours 9-5 UK time.
Reasonable Adjustments Sickness Absence Meeting:
If you are signed off with work-related stress, anxiety, depression or any other
medical condition
, your employer should be making reasonable adjustments for you to attend the sickness absence meeting. Therefore, if you have been invited to attend a sickness absence meeting, but your employer has failed to implement any
reasonable adjustments
for the sickness absence meeting, that would potentially amount to a contravention of s.20(3); s.21(1)(2) & s.39(2)(b)(d)(5) of The Equality Act 2010.
For the avoidance of doubt, there is no onus on you to have to either suggest or request reasonable adjustments for the sickness absence meeting. This position was held in the authority of
Mr C Orogbu v Duncan Lewis Solicitors Ltd
: 3201906/2021 at paragraph 121:
“The duty to make the adjustment arises by operation of law, it is not essential for the claimant to have identified at the time what should have been done. The EHRC Code of Practice on Employment (2011) at paragraph 6.24 says that there is no onus on a disabled person to suggest what adjustments should be made.”
A similar position was also held in the authority of
S v A
2201874/2018
whereas the Employment Tribunal held that:
“The duty to consider whether adjustments should be made and what those particular adjustments should be,
falls squarely on the employer
at the time it is under the duty.”
Sickness Absence Trigger Points:
It is very likely that your employer has written to you to invite you to attend a sickness absence meeting because you have triggered the sickness absence trigger point.
The majority of employers will have a trigger point within the sickness absence policy.
As such, if your sickness absence is ‘disability-related’ then your employer MUST readjust the sickness absence ‘trigger point’ within the sickness absence policy.
For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to adjust the sickness absence ‘trigger point’ if your sickness absence is ‘disability-related’ could amount to ‘discrimination arising in consequence of disability’ in contravention of s.15 of The Equality Act 2010.
In this regard, we draw your attention to The EHRC Code of Practice on Employment at Chapter 17, Paragraph 6.20:
“Employers are not automatically obliged to disregard all disability-related sickness absences, but they must disregard some or all of the absences by way of an adjustment if this is reasonable. If an employer takes action against a disabled worker for disability-related sickness absence, this may amount to discrimination arising from disability (see Chapter 5).”
The Courts have held that employees with a disability or impairment will likely have a higher rate of sickness absence. See
Parnaby v Leicester City Council
UKEAT/0025/19/BA at paragraph 14:
“It was also well known that someone suffering from a mental impairment would be at a higher risk of that impairment recurring”
To this end, if you have a disability or impairment and your employer has failed to amend its sickness absence trigger point for you, or is applying the
Bradford Factor
for your sickness absence from work, reach out to Amy & I at:

or call is 9-5 on 07775943414.
