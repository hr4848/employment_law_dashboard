June 2025
I’d read the glowing testimonials about Sam, but I still wasn’t sure if he could really help
me
. I was overwhelmed, unsure where to turn, and honestly just looking for a bit of guidance on how to deal with an Occupational Health referral. I didn’t expect much – maybe a quick steer. But from the moment Sam picked up the phone, I knew I’d found someone different. Sam was calm, sharp, and completely tuned in.
After just a few minutes of listening, he paused and said:
“You need to protect yourself
.”
That sentence shifted everything. I hadn’t even realised what I was dealing with – but Sam did. I wasn’t sure what he meant at the time. I didn’t think I had a case as everything had happened in such a short space of time. You usually hear of cases involving months or years of discrimination. In my case, just three weeks passed between requesting parental leave and reasonable adjustments to alleged performance concerns being raised. It felt sudden and disorienting but Sam instantly recognised the pattern.
I booked a full consultation the next day and that’s when our journey began. Sam listened carefully and helped me connect the dots. He showed me that the timing
itself was the evidence.  I decided to engage Sam to write my grievance letter for me as I lacked the confidence, but after reading what Sam had created I returned to work with clarity, confidence, and direction. I finally understood what was happening and felt protected.
When the grievance outcome came later, it was full of contradictions. It tried to minimise what had happened, while quietly confirming much of what I had raised. My employer’s legal team had spent 10 weeks trying to work out how to avoid litigation. The actual investigation only took seven weeks; it was the legal team who were left scratching their heads for much longer! Sam and I put together a dual-response appeal – Sam outlined employment law, while I focused on the personal account. Together, it gave structure, credibility, and a voice to everything I had experienced. The formal process isn’t over yet as I’m still waiting for the outcome of my appeal. It’s an uncertain place to be, and I may still need Sam’s support, depending on what comes next. But even now, I continue to reach out when I need guidance and every time, he’s there. Calm, clear, and completely committed.
Just knowing he’s still in my corner gives me the reassurance I need to keep going. If I hadn’t taken Sam’s guidance I’d be at the end of a pre-determined performance plan by now—out the door—all from what I originally thought was just a straightforward Occupational Health referral. If something doesn’t feel right at work but you’re doubting yourself, talk to Sam. He’ll listen, he’ll understand, and he’ll help you find your footing before you lose it. Sam’s insight is unmatched, his clarity cuts through chaos, and his commitment is unwavering. Sam isn’t just knowledgeable, he genuinely
cares
. He shows up, stays consistent, and never lets you feel like you’re doing this alone. I feel incredibly lucky to have had him in my corner.
Thank you Sam – Tamara

I honestly don’t know where to start. Sam has been nothing short of incredible. What began as support through a stressful employment issue has turned into something more. I now consider Sam a friend, someone who’s taught me a lot and given me lessons I’ll carry with me moving forward.
Sam was always there when I needed him, no matter the time or how overwhelmed I felt. He gave me clarity when things were chaotic, strength when I felt defeated and never let me lose sight of what was fair and right. What stood out most was Sam’s ruthlessness when it counted. Calm, kind and endlessly patient with me, but absolutely fearless in dealing with the situation. Sharp, strategic, and never afraid to call things out exactly as they were. I felt completely supported, respected and empowered throughout.
I couldn’t have got through this without Sam and I’ll always be grateful. Not just for the professional support, but for the loyalty, honesty and genuine care he showed every step of the way.

If you are facing a workplace issue, I highly recommend Sam and I genuinely encourage you to book a session. You really won’t regret it. From the very first conversation, Sam’s expertise, patience, and genuine care made a world of difference during what was a stressful time. Navigating a workplace grievance can feel incredibly daunting, but Sam provided clear, structured, and reassuring guidance that gave me the confidence to take things forward.
The one-to-one session was very helpful. Sam really took the time to understand the ins and outs of my situation, offering tailored guidance that made me feel both empowered and in control. This wasn’t just some generic advice you can find online. Sam’s support was thoughtful, strategic, and effective. He has a fantastic way of breaking down complicated workplace policies and legal jargon into straightforward, practical steps. Thanks to Sam’s guidance, I was able to submit a strong, well-structured grievance letter, which led to a successful outcome. I honestly don’t think I would have managed it without his support. Many thanks Sam, for all your help!

My partner used Sam’s services about four years ago when her employer at the time tried to push her out of the business under the disguise of gross misconduct. I have to say I was dubious about her putting her trust in and internet stranger. However, with Sams expertise she was able to reach a settlement. She still calls him the rottweiler!  I had recently found myself in a similar situation, a farce redundancy process.
Initially I was going to go with it, but I thought no, this isn’t right. My partner suggested getting in touch with Sam. I had an initial consultation with Sam where he said,” Redundancy, it’s not really my area of expertise, but if I were you I’d” – Sam then over the next 10 minutes proceeded to verbally dictate a grievance for me.
I wrote up the grievance confident that that it would send my employer into a spin. It did, they got nasty and tried every trick in the book to make my life hell. Once I had my grievance outcome which was unsurprisingly against me. I sent it to Sam asking what he thought – It was a hold my beer moment – Sam expertly crafted at 31 page grievance appeal letter for me. Where he eloquently called my employer a moron, amongst other things that should never be said out loud. At the same time he suggested I start the early conciliation process with ACAS.
It took ACAS 3 weeks to allocate my case, and I am happy to say that with Sam’s expert guidance my employer decided to settle with me. If it wasn’t for my ex-employer putting me in this situation, I wouldn’t now be starting my dream job at my dream company.
Thanks Sam – Aiden

I cannot recommend Sam Stone highly enough for the way he handled my fight against my employer. As someone who is pregnant, this was an incredibly stressful time for me, but Sam took all of the pressure off my shoulders and managed everything with professionalism, expertise, and determination.
From the outset, Sam was thorough, strategic, and incredibly knowledgeable. He came back at my employer with well-researched case law for every point they tried to fight me on, ensuring that my position was strong and well-supported. His attention to detail and ability to challenge them effectively gave me complete confidence that I was in the best possible hands. Not only did Sam help me secure a fair outcome, but he also provided unwavering support and reassurance throughout the process.
His assertive approach made what was an overwhelming experience so much more manageable. I am truly grateful for his dedication and would highly recommend him to anyone.
Kindest Regards Erika

I cannot thank Sam enough for the unwavering support and expertise he provided throughout a year-long battle—one of the most challenging and traumatic experiences of my life. As my employment consultant, Sam not only guided me through the complexities of my grievances and grievance appeal but also gave me the confidence to stand firm in my pursuit of justice.
I found myself at the center of vexatious allegations, flawed processes, and deeply unfair outcomes within a public service body, all while facing disability discrimination from my employer. What should have been a fair and transparent process instead became a battle against systemic failures, leaving me feeling powerless. But Sam saw through it all. With his sharp legal mind and strategic approach, he was able to turn the tables on my employer 180 degrees, exposing their failures and holding them to account.
Thanks to Sam’s expertise, I successfully obtained a settlement via ACAS Early Conciliation—a result that would not have been possible without Sam’s guidance. Over the course of the year, his incredible responsiveness, patience, and relentless dedication kept me going. No matter how complex or frustrating the process became, he always made time to answer my questions, respond to correspondence immediately, and provide the reassurance I needed. His ability to provide clear, timely guidance was invaluable during such a stressful and uncertain time. I had hoped to be able to add to Sam’s ever-increasing number of glowing testimonials—and now, I have.
After a year of fighting for fairness, I can say with certainty that I could not have done this without him. If you need someone who is not only astute but also tenacious, strategic, and deeply invested in your case, I wholeheartedly recommend Sam. Thank you so much again – it really would have been a different outcome for me if I’d have not fought back.
Many thanks Jacqueline

Sam helped me navigate an incredibly distressing and challenging grievance process, as well as a long-running situation at work that severely impacted my health. Sam’s knowledge, expertise, and emotional support are truly unparalleled. The grievance process is tough, to say the least—once you lodge your grievance, you’ll witness levels of dishonesty and manipulation from your employer that you never imagined possible. Without Sam’s guidance, it would have been nearly impossible to withstand the relentless dirty tricks which employers use to undermine your case. Sam Stone is one in a million, every tactic they throw at you, Sam counters with solutions that shut them down.
The psychological toll of a formal grievance is immense, and I can’t overstate how invaluable Sam’s support has been. His dedication, strategic approach, and unwavering commitment to justice make his service worth every penny. Even with Sam’s support, this process is brutal—but without him, I can’t imagine how much worse it would have been. If you’re going through something similar, working with Sam is hands down one of the best decisions you can make. I couldn’t recommend Sam highly enough. He’s more effective than any solicitor I’ve encountered and genuinely goes above and beyond to fight for your rights and put you in the strongest position possible. Thank you for everything you do, Sam!

After experiencing incredibly personal circumstances that led to a long absence from work, I returned to find myself in a vulnerable and challenging position. It quickly became clear that my return was met with scepticism, and despite having had no prior issues aside from my absence, I felt as though I had a target on my back.
This left me feeling utterly helpless, and in my time of need, I reached out to Sam and Amy for support. When I spoke with Sam, I immediately sensed his understanding and empathy. He truly related to what I was going through and offered guidance that made a world of difference. Sam was always there for me, responding promptly and going above and beyond to help me.
His unwavering support gave me the mental strength and courage to pursue my complaint through the grievance process. On the days when self-doubt crept in and I felt like giving up, just one conversation with Sam was enough to lift my spirits and renew my confidence. I continue to fight my case, but thanks to everything Sam has set up for me, I feel hopeful about achieving a positive outcome. Sam isn’t afraid to speak the truth and to back it up with his knowledge to bolster my case.
What could have been an incredibly stressful experience addressing workplace issues was made manageable and even bearable due to Sam’s expertise and steadfast support. I have learned so much, and I will always be grateful for the compassion and guidance he provided during this difficult time. Thank you Sam!
Kind Regards Edward

Sam is the rottweiler of the employment dispute word.  A totally unique, well-informed professional who ‘got’ our plight from the outset. His integrity is solid. A man of the cause rather than of the money.
He didn’t cut corners and wrote one letter of 40 pages that hit such a hard punch, we expect the ‘ex-employer’ is still traumatised. Another letter was 70 pages packed with chunks of employment law and disability discrimination evidence. The ex-employer was cornered and had nowhere to go. In fact, they ignored most of the letter because they were not able to deal with it, which all added to the evidence against them!
A friend of ours had a work-related dispute at the same time and chose to go down the solicitor route. She was presented with 2 sides of A4 of a grievance letter and ended up rewriting it herself. This cost her just short of £2k. Sam is well worth the fees he charges. Sam prepared us for all eventualities including Occupational Health.
Sam more than once threw the ‘ex-employer’ a metal bone to chew on, which promptly blunted their teeth! We fell upon Sam’s website after an in-depth search surrounding suspension from work. We’d researched everything and made several calls to ACAS – to no avail.  We were in the dark of how to proceed until we found Sam. We are indebted to him for all he has done and we also may even consider getting ourselves a ‘rotty’ in future thanks to him!
Kindest regards Nicky

I contacted Sam at short notice to write my appeal letter. I have no regrets contacting Sam. He is a pleasure to deal with and is very professional. I am more than happy with my grievance appeal letter, it’s amazing. He definitely knows his stuff.
After I’d paid and whilst waiting the short amount of time for Sam to draft the appeal letter, I had a moment of panic/terror. I suddenly thought what had I done as this could be a scam! I telephoned Sam and he assured me that I had nothing to worry about. He was right. Sam drafted my appeal letter in a way, which I could not have done myself.
I would definitely recommend Sam 100%.

I was lucky enough to find Sam after researching who could help with my employment issue, I was literally at my wits end dealing with employment lawyers that wanted over one hundred pounds for 10 minutes consultation. All I got was a lot of dribble and more confusion. Sam Stone is not just knowledgeable with every aspect of employment law, the Martin Lewis of employment law I would say, he is a true gentleman.  He treats you with respect and understands how stressful the whole process is.
I am an ex-veteran, and my situation has been harder to navigate than the war in the middle east and more stressful…. And that’s some comment to make. Speak to this man. I can guarantee you will get through whatever it is you have to deal with. These large corporations are not only toxic when you turn and stand up for your rights, they are also incompetent with the law.  They are not match for Sam. Without you Sam, I would be in a real mess by now, if here at all. So many thanks for everything.

I would like to express my enormous gratitude to Sam for his unwavering support over the past two years. I faced an incredibly complex case involving false allegations made against me by a school. These past two years have been a challenging fight to defend my innocence and clear my name.
Throughout this difficult journey, Sam provided invaluable support and guidance, drawing on his extensive knowledge of employment law, human rights, and other complex legal areas. His ability to formalize and articulate my thoughts and emotions in a professional manner was instrumental in my case.
Thanks to Sam’s expertise and dedication, I have successfully cleared my name, and all charges against me have been dropped.

I approached Sam for help with my grievance appeal which had to be completed within 5 working days.  Sam was not phased by the time frame despite having other clients.  I spoke to him on Friday and by Sunday he had completed the letter of appeal.
After reading it I was quite emotional as Sam had very succinctly written a fantastic appeal letter which encapsulated everything I had gone through at my company.  It was better than any solicitor could have written.  This was also endorsed by a friend of mine who works in HR.  She said it was one of the best letters she had ever seen and she has been in HR for 30 years!
Sam has an in depth knowledge of employment law and his letter for my appeal used these points to write a very strong letter which would be extremely hard to argue with. If anyone has seen the film ‘ Clash of the Titans’ then Sam is the Titan you want on your side.  I am so glad I found him.  Don’t bother with an employment solicitor.  Sam is the only person you need.

I reached a breaking point with my employer as my health deteriorated, and I felt completely lost about how to resolve my situation. After a quick online search, I came across Sam’s website.
Reading the testimonials gave me hope that he could help. It was a Sunday when I reached out, and we arranged a call for Monday—an impressively efficient start.  In our first call, Sam listened carefully and quickly recognized that I had been subjected to disability discrimination.
With his expertise, he guided me through the process of filing a formal grievance with my employer. Sam anticipated every tactic they might use and manoeuvred so effectively that they’ve been hesitant to put anything in writing.  Sam has expertly guided me through Occupational Health Assessments, investigation meetings, and ensured that every step remained fully within legal bounds, upholding my employment rights at every turn.
When my employer responded with a vague replyto my grievance, Sam swiftly drafted a strong appeal letter. His ability to predict their moves has been astonishing—like a chess grandmaster, always ten steps ahead. It’s been an emotionally challenging journey, but we’re now nearing the end, with a significant settlement in sight. Without Sam’s support, I would never have come this far.
I’d describe Sam as the Mike Tyson of employment law. He’s relentless and strategic, dodging every move your employer throws at him and delivering knockout blows that leave them stunned. Like Tyson in his prime, he stays laser-focused on your case, anticipating every tactic and countering with precision. Sam doesn’t just fight for you—he dominates, leaving your employer wondering what hit them. Forget hiring a solicitor—Sam is the one you want in your corner.

Sam has been a calm, steadying force in the extremely stressful process of raising a grievance with my employer.  He expertly guided me through the grievance process and all the ups and downs to reach a successful conclusion.  His knowledge of employment law is incredible and very reassuring.
I feel I’ve learnt so much along the way.  Before talking to Sam, I wanted to throw in the towel, other people had said don’t put in a grievance.  I’m so glad I followed my instincts and listened to Sam.  He showed me the way forward, step by step and supported my decision to not give up and to fight my corner.
My voice was heard.  Sam is worth his weight in gold.  Without his expert assistance, rigour and precision, I would not have reached a positive outcome and my future would have been bleak.
A huge thank you to Sam – you are a true ally in the grievance process and a shining beacon!  I would recommend you 100% without hesitation.
Kindest regards Sadie

I just wanted to drop a message to extend my deepest gratitude for your invaluable support and guidance throughout the entire process of resolving my employment issues. I am thrilled to inform you that the settlement has been finalized, and am starting my new job tomorrow. I can confidently say that this outcome would not have been possible without your exceptional expertise and dedication. Your meticulous attention to detail in documenting the grievances I raised to my employer was nothing short of extraordinary.
The precision and thoroughness with which you crafted each document and prepared me for every step were key factors in reaching a favorable resolution. Your assistance and unwavering support gave me the confidence to navigate the complexities of this situation and stand up for myself. Thanks to you, I have been able to leave my previous role on my own terms, preserving my integrity and dignity. Your guidance has not only helped me achieve a just agreement but also opened the door to a new and much better workplace environment. I am excited to start my new job, knowing that I have learned so much from this experience and have grown both personally and professionally.
Your commitment to my grievances and disciplinary issues and your belief in my cause were a constant source of encouragement. You provided a sense of clarity and direction when things seemed uncertain, and your reassurances kept me grounded. Your ability to combine legal acumen with genuine empathy is truly remarkable, and I am profoundly grateful for everything you have done for me. I cannot thank you enough for your relentless efforts and the positive impact you have had on my life. You have been more than just an employment consultant; you were a beacon of hope during a challenging situation. I am now moving forward with a renewed sense of purpose and optimism, and I owe a significant part of this newfound strength to you.Thank you once again, Sam, for your exceptional work, unwavering support, and for helping me achieve a successful resolution. I am forever grateful.
Kind Regards – Adrian
June 2024
Sam helped me when I was suspended from work following a complaint I had made about my manager. The usual solicitors advice was to sit and wait, but I reached out to Sam who informed me of putting in a formal grievance letter. Sam provided templates which I could use. I would recommend reaching out to Sam, his assistance is from years of experience; I was getting conflicting advice from union.
I believe that Sam’s actions from the outset helped influence my employers next action. I ended leaving my employment, which was my choice since the relationship had broken down. However, I received a good package, and again I believe that this was due to taking action at the start based in Sam’s recommendations. Reach out to Sam and you will get the help you need based on his own experience and knowledge of employment matters. His fees are very reasonable.
Thanks Sam. Hilda
May 2024
I contacted Sam in Feb 2024 because the relationship between myself and my employer had reached the point that I felt I had very little choice but to raise a letter of grievance. I had up to this point been using an employment lawyer, but within 15 minutes of my initial consultation with Sam, it was clear that his expertise and passion was something that could prove very useful for me.  Sam’s tenacity and attention to detail lead to a grievance that was first class in its presentation. Sam helped me navigate the best way to go forward, even when my employer was trying to bully me into doing things that I did not have to do under employment law. It’s not easy raising a grievance against your employer, but with Sam there, I felt empowered to take it forward in such a way, that my employer knew I was not prepared to be ‘pushed’ around.
The information and guidance that Sam provided, lead, in the end, to a successful outcome, that negated the need for a tribunal. I highly recommend Sam. He was far more knowledgeable than any lawyer I’ve ever spoken to and is on the side of the individual with the sole intent of getting a fair outcome. Thank you Sam.

Sam has been a powerhouse from the beginning of our consultation. I applied to my employer for remote working due to disability and 8 months later they still hadn’t approved it. I was constantly being asked when I was coming in to the office and could I try more days each week. This was causing me a huge amount of stress and anxiety.  I booked a consultation with Sam who composed a formal grievance letter which I sent to my employer.
Just one month later my request to be based 100% remotely has been approved, with an apology for the protracted length of time it took them to make a decision! The assistance Sam has given me every step of the way has been invaluable, what to agree to with occupational health and how to handle the response of my employer. His knowledge of the equalities act and case law were paramount. This coupled with his guidance and  knowledge what my employer was likely to do next were invaluable. I am sure I would not have got the result I needed without Sam’s help and support and I cannot recommend Sam him highly enough.
Many thanks

Within 10 minutes of my telephone consultation with Sam, I knew I had met the ‘Martin Lewis’ of employment law. A strong communicator who operates from a trustful stance to ensure you navigate challenging employment difficulties with precision and rigour.

I found Sam’s website after much searching looking for a way to get some justice in a grievance that had been dismissed out of hand and left me feeling at my lowest point both mentally and health wise. The appeal letter Sam drafted for me was nothing short of brilliant and was something i couldn’t have hoped to have ever written myself such was his incredible knowledge of case law, professional wording and attention to detail.
Armed with Sam’s appeal letter i finally have some real belief that l can turn the tables and be taken seriously by the disingenuous HR department and my harasser who have made my life a misery and work towards a fair settlement. – without doubt the best money i have ever spent! Cannot overstate how professional and patient Sam has been with me from start to finish and i can honestly say without any fear of contradiction, that if you have found yourself here under similar circumstances as me you are about to make an important ally and have your hope restored.

When you raise a grievance to your employer you will need to find an inner strength and belief in yourself that you didn’t know you had. You will need to stand tall. It is frightening. It can be upsetting and it can lead to unwarranted stress related health problems. This is no ‘walk in the park’, believe me. You will have little or no awareness of employment law. The mode of procedure will confuse you……..that is unless you are blessed enough to have Sam to steer you through the process.
Sam gave me an understanding of the approach we were going to take in a clear and concise way. He gave me the confidence to stand up for myself, figuratively holding my hand while I navigated the ups and down, to draw on a successful conclusion. I cannot recommend Sam highly enough. His knowledgeable calm and reassuring self will be at your side throughout the process.

From the initial consultation with Sam he instilled me with confidence and was able to give clear unbiased no nonsense guidance. Sometimes it’s not what you want to hear but Sam really does know his stuff. It felt like a leap of faith paying for his services but the grievance letter that Sam put together from my evidence was way beyond anything I could have written myself. (I am a Union member and the Union cannot help with the grievance letter). The grievance letter Sam wrote for me was so comprehensive, focussed and professional and you really do have only one opportunity to get the first grievance letter right. It set the scene for what was quite a difficult confrontation with my employer, but Sam was there to assist and support me throughout. I am now at the end of the process and more than happy with the outcome (that Sam did predict). I can now move forward with my life both professionally and personally. However, without Sam’s help I am in no doubt I would not be in this position and would be still trying to fight a large organisation on my own. I can’t thank Sam enough for this and if you are reading this and wondering if it is worth paying for Sam’s advice the answer is categorically yes.

Sam helped me get a good outcome to the grievance procedures.  Everyone else (including my union) said ‘just accept’ the ‘not upheld’ I was given at grievance outcome stage.  The ‘not upheld’ represented to me the acceptance of what I saw as unacceptable treatment which had been subjected to by bullying management, thus the ‘not upheld’ in my eyes was as good as giving the green light for such unacceptable treatment to continue.  My confidence was rock bottom. Sam suggested doing an appeal.  I listened to him.  Had I not found Sam I would definitely have dropped the matter.  I would have been just too frightened and worn down to fight my corner and the future would have been bleak indeed.  It can take guts sometimes to carry on, when you feel alone, but once you contact Sam you are not alone – the knowledge Sam and Amy have and the confidence boost you get, when you speak with them turbo charges you.
There are actually some decent grievance/ appeals managers out there, some decent human beings, there are also plenty of scum bag ones in HR, but either way you need a strong grievance and strong appeal letter because if it is weak not even a decent appeal/ grievance manager can help you even if they wanted to. That’s where Sam helped me, he helped me get my ducks in a row, my letters to a very high standard, he explained stuff I didn’t understand, coming back to me quickly, so I could better defend myself and as a result I am better off for it.  I got a good outcome.
Thank you Sam and Amy.

Having spent quite some time assuming that my employers valued me enough not to shaft me when my department restructured, I had not joined a union, and did not have any legal representation when it came to the point that I needed to take out a grievance. Whilst I had studied employment law a couple of time a long time ago, it seems that the emotional stress of the situation that my employer had put me in over several years had caused me to forget quite a lot of it, and when I read the finished 47 page long grievance letter that Sam prepared, I was in tears at quite how badly the people I had worked with had breached their duty of care to me. I had worked with these people for 7 years and was also astonished that they thought I was so spineless to agree to take a lower paid job they offered, ringfenced at my then salary for 2 years.
I had gathered evidence over the period of the restructuring, being conscious that my employer (my manager, the HR business partner, the consultation email helpline) was ignoring me and that I didn’t have the best relationship with my manager, whose people skills are very poor. I drafted a timeline of the discrimination including examples and appendices evidencing the examples I gave. Sam was able to pull together all the points of law my employer had breached, attaching further examples that I had shared with him showing where I had ‘blown the whistle’ separately to my manager, the HRBP and a senior HR manager, all of whom had ignored me, fobbed me off and eventually responded with an offer for the job which was substantively lower paid. Having been through this himself, Sam knows how the employer will work against the employee whilst trying to appear on their side. I was happy to meet with the independent legal counsel they recommended, until Sam looked him up on linkedin and found that he was the litigation director of an employer legal advice company with ‘over 30 years experience of acting on the employer’s behalf in employment tribunals’. Clearly, not quite that independent. Sam was also able to write back to my employer with the legal reasons why they should not have put me into half pay, having been off sick for 6 months. They agreed, refunded what they had not paid and continued to pay sick pay until my employment terminated.
This alone was worth Sam’s fees! In the end, I settled with my employer rather than go to the full tribunal. Unfortunately, I don’t think they will learn any lessons from the experience, despite having had to pay me a largish chunk of taxpayer funds. The help and expertise Sam provided was invaluable and it was a massive relief to have someone telling me authoritatively that yes, I was right, their behaviour was unlawful, unfair, and unreasonable. I wholeheartedly endorse Sam’s service to anyone who has the misfortune to need it, although would not wish to need it again!

Sam’s expertise and guidance were instrumental in helping me navigate a complex grievance situation, ultimately resulting in a substantial settlement that exceeded my expectations. When I initially reached out to Sam, I was overwhelmed by the legal intricacies and the daunting prospect of advocating for my rights. Sam Stone quickly reassured me with his extensive knowledge and experience. He demonstrated a deep understanding of the nuances of my case and immediately set to work, meticulously structuring my grievance with precision and attention to detail.

The letters, grievance documents, and appeals crafted by Sam are incisive, legally sound, and meticulously supported by evidence. They strike with precision, leaving no room for any rebuttals due to Sam’s profound understanding of employment law and the employer’s mistakes.
Words cannot sufficiently convey my gratitude for Sam’s actions. Thank you, Sam, for everything you have done for me. May you be blessed abundantly!

First and foremost, to whoever is reading this and needs help, assistance, and guidance with navigating the uncompromising situation you find yourself in, then look no further than Sam. Honestly is help, support and knowledge has help me achieve the perfect outcome, as like you, I was discriminated against and didn’t know whom or where to seek help and assistance. It can be expensive, draining, and emotional compromising. It effects your mental state seriously and from the get-go Sam could understand and relate, but most important assist. Yes, there is a price but they’re not unreasonable. You are not alone nor powerless. There are good people like Sam they want to help and can.
Sam might not like me saying this however one letter he did for free and another very important letter that won me the settlement cost me £700 for Sam to write. But that is insignificant to my dignity, reward, and self-esteem. I won – not them; I can move on knowing in the end I won. However it was with Sam’s guidance and letters. The letters Sam writes are serious. There is no hiding for the victimisers. Lastly, I say don’t give up. Get your evidence. Get the smoking gun, as your position is only as good as the evidence you have and give Sam a call, he will discuss you case and structure a winning formula. Get started now, don’t wait. Thank you, Sam and formal grievance, for your invaluable assistance, as I have an NDA I cannot say more as much as I would like to. Please don’t feel alone, get Sam on your side and work to get that which you deserve.

Sam is very direct in his approach which helps to focus the minds of all involved. His attention to detail on the facts means that any emotional chit chat is excluded as he wastes no time in highlighting the key points and relevant responsibilities as set out in employment law.
His detailed correspondence helped me secure a favourable conclusion to my case without having to go to a tribunal. I have no hesitation in recommending his excellent services.
All the very best – James

In the midst of a very daunting situation that I had found myself in, I had come across Sam’s website. From the very first moment, it became abundantly clear that I had discovered a treasure trove of knowledge and insight unlike anything else available online. Sam’s ability to articulate complex legal matters into concise and manageable actions is truly remarkable, his sharp intellect and comprehension of the intricacies involved in my grievance procedure even rival the most experienced of solicitors I consulted. Sam’s contribution went far beyond letter writing and offering guidance, he has a genuine desire to help.
It is no exaggeration when I say that without Sam’s support I would have been lost. He has instilled in me the confidence to navigate through the challenges. If you are reading this, I imagine you are at a stage where you are overwhelmed and are filled with uncertainty. I implore you to reach out to Sam as I did.

There is no doubt in my mind that Sam is a master of his some what niche craft!  Without his help and guidance over the past 5 months I would have been lost and out of a job, but instead I’m out of a job on my terms with a healthy compensation package and a new job starting in a couple of weeks time.
It didn’t take me long during my first conversation with Sam to decide that the only chance I had of getting a positive outcome, out of what was a pretty dire situation, was to trust in Sam’s incredible knowledge & expertise.
To give you some background to my situation I had returned to work after a prolonged period off due to illness and after a few months of me returning my employer, out of the blue, booked me in for a Performance Improvement Plan meeting with H.R and my new manager. There was no prior warning and I didn’t know what to do, so I started to search on the Internet for Grievance templates and thankfully I stumbled across Sam’s website. I initially purchased a couple of the Grievance letter templates and started to try and cobble together my own Grievance letter, but I found this to be above my skill set, and thankfully for me I decided to book in for a consultation with Sam.
It was evident from the very first moments of the consultation that Sam’s knowledge of employment law is outstanding, and I will ever be indebted to him for the way he guided me through the process and for the Grievance/appeal letters he wrote for me. At times i needed to strap myself in, as Sam certainly gave it both barrels to my employer, over and over again! So please bear this in mind, but do trust in Sam’s abilities. Initially when I would read the letters they would make me laugh out loud at times, as I could only imagine the look on my employers face when they were reading what I’d submitted… For complete transparency this laughter would sometimes turn in to anxiety, as the letters Sam wrote were very hard hitting, but I was so confident in Sam’s capabilities and what he was saying on my behalf this would go away. Sam’s responsiveness was above and beyond what I could’ve hoped for, as there were a number of occasions I’d send him my employers responses and he’d come back to me with a response to send in the following day! I did have to take a leap of faith after my consultation with Sam as for him to write my initial Grievance letter I had to pay a somewhat considerable amount of money to someone I’d never met and had only ever spoken to over the phone. However, I can reassure whoever may read this that you get exactly what you pay for, and quite possibly alot more besides.
Perhaps naively, it was some way down the line that I read other people’s testimonials on Sam’s website, and I couldn’t agree more with everybody else’s comments. Sam is direct, funny, helpful, responsive, but above all he knows his stuff and knows how to get you the outcome you want. I will ever be gratetful to Sam for what he did for me, and I can’t thank him enough! I hope I never have to go through such an experience again, but if I did, Sam will be my first point of contact.

Sam is the Guru of employment.  You won’t find anyone with his level of knowledge, or quick wit anywhere else and believe me I’ve looked.  I have yet to meet a union representative who has his level of expertise.  To me when dealing with monsters at work, It’s not a case of ‘Who you gonna call?  Ghost Busters!’  It’s ‘who you gonna call?  Sam Stone!’  His judgement is second to none in my experience. Sam has quickly seen through the tricks and games HR like to play to make employees lives a total misery, which frankly without Sam I would have been unaware of.  He helps steer the fragile ship, to safer waters which he’s currently doing for me at a time when I am extremely stressed and struggling to cope.  He has in the past helped me win grievances and once again he is helping me.  Sam you are the Guru!  There is no-one else like you. Thank you. Gail.

If you find yourself here, like me, you are experiencing difficulties at work, the stress is overwhelming and you are wondering what to do. I knew what was happening was wrong and I was being discriminated against, with barriers put in the way to prevent me returning to work following a long period of sickness absence. My union were totally ineffective and I needed help. I knew I wanted to raise a grievance but didn’t know how to go about it and realised when I did that it needed to be well written to be taken seriously.
A google search, led me to Sam’s website and I thought it seemed too good to be true. I was apprehensive about contacting Sam but when I did he put me at ease immediately. It was clear from that initial phone call that he understood what I was experiencing and how it needed to be tackled. Sam is friendly and approachable and what he doesn’t know about employment law is not worth knowing. He is kind and will go the extra mile, returning calls promptly and being there for reassurance every step of the way. I was anxious about making that first PayPal payment but it was honestly the best decision. Sam packs a punch and my employer has had to sit up and think. It is not over by any means. An internal grievance process is taking forever. However, I have now returned to work and firmly believe that without Sam’s input I would be out of a job and dismissed through ill health capability. I’d urge you to contact Sam if you are in any doubt. He is definitely your man and you will not be disappointed. Thank you Sam for giving me the strength to persevere with my grievances and writing the best letters.

How do I put into words how amazing Sam is… From the bottom of my heart, I can only repeat and endorse all of the testimonies written on Sam’s site. That said, and no doubt like me, when you first come across Sam and read through the endless testimonies and praise, you can’t help but think “this is too good to be true, there must be a catch or a con… surely!?” But through my own experience I can genuinely say that there isn’t, and all I can urge you to do if you think Sam can help you or assist you in any way, is to contact him – you really have nothing to lose and potentially everything to gain! When I first raised a grievance against my employer for bullying, harassment and discrimination, I felt completely lost and bewildered – not to mention threatened and intimated by my employer. But Sam was my beacon of light, strength, support, and expertise, and I could not have raised a formal grievance or gone through the subsequent process without him. I won’t lie, going down this road is not a quick or easy journey, and there were plenty of times when I felt utterly defeated and convinced that giving up and handing in my notice was the only thing to do.
But Sam’s phenomenal knowledge of employment law, his sharp, brutal and exception writing skills, and kind, witty personality, were invaluable to me and gave me the confidence and tenacity to continue the fight and for what is right and fair. Sam is extremely friendly and approachable and always made time for me even at short notice, evenings or weekends – I genuinely don’t know how he does it! He was always at the end of the phone to answer the many questions and queries (often fraught with anxiety!), that I frequently had, and without fail always provided calm, concise and honest guidance.
Sam also helped me to liaise and communicate correctly and effectively with my employer, drafting many emails and letters for me that were not only exceptional in their brevity and content, but thanks to Sam’s amazing knowledge, experience and tactical insight, he always kept me one step ahead of my employer. I eventually got the outcome that I desired and that’s all thanks to Sam. I hope I never find myself in a similar situation with an employer again but if I do, or if any of my friends or family should, I would not hesitate to enlist or recommend this fantastic man.
Thank you Sam x”

I returned to work after maternity in 2020 and my manager’s attitude towards me had changed considerably, I couldn’t quite put my finger on it until a HR meeting revealed she was making notes based on my performance. Overworked, stressed, looking after a 2-year-old in the midst of Covid 19 and dealing with personal issues, she placed me on a performance plan (PIP). Fast forward 5 months another performance plan and then she catapulted me to a capability hearing – a cunning plan to manage me out. My face no longer fitted in with her strategic vision, so she wanted me out. My mental health and physical well-being began to suffer and I contemplated leaving and finding another job, but the voice inside was saying “no I can’t let her get away with this again” so I came across Sam, he swiftly arranged a meeting with me over the phone, speaking to Sam for the first time really put my mind at ease, he made me realise that my grievances were serious and that my employer needed to be held accountable for their failures and omissions. He gave me the courage to progress with the whole grievance process, which I was reluctant to do because I didn’t think I stood a chance against a multi-million pound company. I briefly explained my situation and then sent Sam a detailed email, we spoke a second time and Sam told me exactly what I needed to do, I was simply amazed how quickly Sam grasped the situation in such a short space of time – it was as if a weight had been lifted…Sam firstly invoked grievance and whistleblowing procedures and then put together a 32-page grievance letter outlining the direct/indirect race, religious and disability discrimination I was being subjected too. I still remember Sam saying, “we need to strike whilst the Iron’s still hot” and that’s exactly what we did! My manager, HR and company didn’t see this coming (oh, what I would have done to be a fly on the wall).
Sam’s knowledge and understanding of employment law, case law and the equality act is exquisite – the company legal team just could not get around him. Letter after letter my employer was getting into deeper waters, and it was finally the appeal letter Sam wrote for me that sealed the deal! It was nothing short of excellence, the final nail in the coffin. The Employment Lawyer, who my employer hired to investigate my grievance (who had 20 years’ experience) just didn’t know where to start or should I say ‘didn’t want to unravel Sam’s brilliance. What followed was ‘music to my ears’ – “what figure do you want to settle this”?
Fast forward 12 months, yes, that’s how long Sam has supported and guided me through the whole grievance process, from the grievance letters, email responses and appeal, I can honestly say ‘hand on heart’ had I not found Sam I would not have achieved the settlement offered by my employer today. Sam gave me the courage to fight this and there is light at the end of the tunnel, so if you find yourself in a dispute with your employer, don’t be hesitant, contact Sam, he can’t promise you anything but my goodness he’ll fight your corner (literally, every step of the way)! My only advice is listen to his every word and every move and success won’t be far away. Words cannot justify how thank full I am to Sam, it’s been a privilege having you on my side helping me through the darkest days of my life. I can finally move on, rebuild my health, and start a fresh equipped with knowledge surrounding employment issues. You’ve helped me to fight one of the hardest of battles Sam and my gratitude is endless.

My name is Joseph. I have been working with Sam Stone since June 2022 and he has been providing me with support to effectively understand how to manage the formal grievance which I have lodged to my employer on the grounds of disability discrimination.
Prior to working with Sam, I had no knowledge of my legal rights as a disabled person and I had never raised a formal complaint before as I am only recently diagnosed with a disability. Sam has been exceptional.
Sam has knowledge and expertise that demonstrates his high intellectual abilities. Sam never ceases to amaze me with the skills that he possesses and utilises to help people who are often at risk of being vulnerable and disadvantaged in the labour market.
I have worked exhaustively to seek advice from national organisations and I have previously paid for legal advice, for which, I have never been able to achieve the desired outcomes. I also pay for a trade union membership, for which I have had zero support.
Sam has been flexible, holistic, approachable, reliable, friendly and professional. It has been a privilege to have the opportunity to work with Sam. I have benefited from his help so much, to the point that I now am a repeat customer, who sees the infinite value in the service that Sam Stone is able to provide.
Since working with Sam, I have been able to draft grievance documents, gain an understanding of the Equality Act 2010 which in turn has led to my ability to now begin advocating for myself as a disabled person in the world.
I would highly recommend his services to anyone and I would encourage people to get in touch as soon as you anticipate and/or experience early stage issues in the workplace, in an attempt to not let workplace matters become worse, complex, breakdown the relationship and proceed to tribunal stages.
I am forever grateful to you Sam and without your support I do not believe I would have been able to manage and escalate my issues at work, retain my job, defend my legal rights and address my employer directly. Above all, I am developing skills that will support me as a disabled person, for the rest of my life.
Sam has never pressured me into booking more hours and has been there for me through ‘thick and thin’ allowing me to hire his services when I require it, based on my time and financial budget. Thank you, on behalf of myself and anyone who has had a positive impact made by you.
This service is rare, unique, effective and needed.  All employees, particularly those who are at risk of vulnerability due to disabilities need to access services which improve our chances of remaining in employment.
I am happy to have found Sam Stone. Thank you for changing my life and helping me feel confident as a disabled person and employee.
Kindest regards Joseph

I stumbled across Sam Stone’s website after I was unfairly suspended from work for misconduct. I was a little skeptical when I came across Sam’s website. I couldn’t find much information about him elsewhere on the internet, but one thing was that I was blown away by the wealth of information on his website. I took a step of faith and contacted Sam. He responded back and my lord this angel Sam was my saving grace. He supported me, wrote my grievance, appealed and and guided my response to my email.
Sam is genuine, trustworthy, brutal and very honest throughout the grievance procedure. Through his support I was able to understand more about my rights and stand on my feet and fight my case. I did not even need a solicitor in the end. Long story short I settled my case and was paid out by my employer. Thank you Sam

When I first came across Sam’s website, I was wracked with stress and anxiety following the hostile and discriminatory treatment from my employer, and genuinely feared for my career and my mental health. From the moment I brought Sam onto my side, it felt like I was finally coming up for air. No longer simply a victim of a bullying employer, Sam gave me the tools to stand up for myself and the freedom to focus on my own health and wellbeing. In what became a protracted dispute with my employer, Sam was on hand every step of the way, and his knowledge, diligence and experience made sure my employer was held accountable for every unlawful act.
Having finally reached a resolution with my employer, I can say that approaching Sam was one of the best decisions I have made. Without his support and expertise, I would have certainly been managed and bullied out of the company. Instead, I leave with my head held high, and everything I need to stand up for myself if I ever find myself in a similar situation again. If you are having trouble with your employer and are considering reaching out to Sam, you can be confident that you will be speaking to a confident and compassionate man that really knows his stuff.
Thank you – Keith

I can’t recommend Sam enough. He is a GENIUS (yes, with capital letters, a GENIUS!). His in-depth knowledge regarding Employment law, his dedication towards helping his clients combined with his strategic thinking is not just unique but it arms you up with a shield that will change your current, complex situation you are in with your employer. Working with Sam, it was transformational for me, it changed my life. Through the grievance letters he helped me with, a new world opened up for me where not just I learnt about my legal rights in-depth (like never before in my life) but more importantly, Sam completely changed the outcome of the situation where I found myself with my employer. The results speak by itself. Sam, I can’t describe with words how grateful I am for your help with my grievance letters. Thank you so much again for everything.

I contacted Sam to assist me with my appeal letter after initially writing my own grievance letter, which grievance letter my employer whitewashed. So, after reading my grievance letter and the grievance outcome letter Sam was instantly able to see the flaws in my employer’s response. Sam drafted my appeal letter, which letter had a Mike Tyson punch. Sam is no nonsense. He is black and white and tells you the way it is. That’s just what I needed, someone to fight my corner. At the end of the appeal letter Sam invited my employer to reach a settlement agreement. I think my employer knew Sam had beaten them at their own game. Thanks Sam for everything.

Sam Stone my secret sniper & grievance assassinator! I sought Sam’s help after several
years of mistreatment and discrimination at work. I made contact with Sam. The only regret I have is that I wished I’d discovered him sooner, during the initial stages of my grievance. I was experiencing serious issues at work that involved discrimination, bullying, harassment and victimization. Sam has in depth knowledge of the equality act. I felt privileged to have Sam provide help and support to assist me with drafting my grievances. Sam is very approachable. I felt very apprehensive about trusting anyone concerning my problems at work. I was completely overwhelmed with the entire grievance process until I contacted Sam. Sam took the helm. He made me feel at ease from the outset and gave me the confidence to move forward with my grievances. I would advise anyone facing difficulties in the workplace that is struggling with grievance or disciplinary to instruct Sam’s help and support. I can assure you that he will be the “smoking gun” in your arsenal and your employer will struggle to overcome his knowledge of employment law. It will be the best money you ever spend. Thank you Sam for everything you have done, over and above, I could not have come this far without you. I now have the confidence to fight for justice. Bless you.

We found Sam Stone after googling help for employment grievances. We read through all the information that he provides for free on his website and after a few days of wondering, we took the plunge and emailed him, explaining our work issues. These grievances involved discrimination, bullying/harassment, and victimisation, among others.
We had never experienced anything like this before and therefore we were at a loss to know how to deal with them. If you are wondering, like we did whether Sam was for real, whether he was trustworthy or whether there is a catch, please know that he is a wonderful, wise, and kind man, who will help you find the right solution for you. He also has a great sense of humour, which believe me, you need during these stressful times and situations. He is warm, easy to talk to, down to earth and very quickly we felt like we had known him forever! We can’t thank Sam enough for his help with our employment issues. We contacted him when we were experiencing difficulties with our employer and were at a low point, not knowing where to turn. We couldn’t have managed without his help and knowledge.
He not only knows employment law and case law, but he is supportive and mixes this with a healthy and sometimes wicked, sense of humour. We were really struggling and desperate at the time but finding Sam and using his services was the best decision we could have made. The financial outlay we made was well-worth it, as his expertise is invaluable, and much better value than an employment solicitor.
We actually miss our phone calls with Sam, as he is such a nice and generous guy. He will go above and beyond to sort out your employment issues and will be honest about how you should handle them. He is someone we would recommend as being trustworthy, brilliant at what he does and well worth investing a small financial outlay to achieve the result you want. He literally saved us from losing our minds and we are so grateful to him for not only getting us the result we wanted but doing so in such an efficient and humorous way!
He taught us so much and helped us to get a fantastic settlement from our employer. We can now move on with our lives and start to live a life without the stress that comes from having a bad employer. Sam gets 10 out of 10 from us, he’s a top bloke!

In December 2021, I found myself in a difficult situation in my employment. After 24 year’s service I was suspended pending an investigation which left me belittled and completely bewildered. A new MD had taken over the reins earlier that year and he was very obviously trying to force my resignation as he didn’t like my management skills. After the initial shock of what had happened, I contacted my union rep, who was no help whatsoever, so I began searching online for help. I came across Sam’s page and began reading all of the testimonials. I used two of his letter templates to raise grievances against my employer, one for the suspension and the other for workplace bullying.
I thought I would be able to fight my employer on my own, but very quickly realised that I needed help from Sam. I pondered over contacting Sam for a few days, then after another sleepless night, I took the plunge and sent him an email describing in great detail what had happened to me. Sam emailed me back within an hour and arranged for me to call him later in the morning. That’s when it felt like a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Sam took all of the worry away from me and made me feel upbeat about it all. He was friendly, but very professional at the same time. His knowledge of employment law is astounding and his letters are incredible.
Not only has Sam been a huge support to me, he also went the extra mile and spoke for over an hour to my husband who was feeling very negative about the whole situation. Sam completely put my husband’s mind at rest. Without going into great detail, my case is now finished, I have a settlement agreement that I am happy with, I would never have reached this settlement without Sam’s help. I can now move on with my life and look to the future and I have Sam to thank for that. If you are reading this testimonial on Sam’s page, you must be in a similar position to me. My advice is, don’t think twice about contacting him, he will do everything in his power to get a good outcome for you for a fraction of the price that a solicitor would charge and in my opinion, he is one hundred times better than a solicitor!
Sam is an absolute star, and I will never forget what he has done for me and my family.

What can I say about this man other than – SAM, SAM YOU ARE THE MAN! I found Sam’s webpage after spending nearly a week trying to write my grievance appeal, I downloaded his appeal letter template and realised how out of my depth I was. I made contact with Sam and within 2 hours he had not only grasped everything that was going on, but had the timescale for my appeals submission extended.
From then on he supported, guided, and got me through what I can only describe as a nightmare situation with my employer. Sam’s knowledge of employment law is mind blowing; his ability to grasp the situation in a short space of time is incredible, he understands everything you are going through because he has walked the same path.  He listens to your fears and doubt with such compassion and guides you through it all and helps you to believe that you are right in challenging your employer.
I can only say if you are reading this then you will be experiencing something similar to me, take that leap of faith and speak to Sam. His support and intervention in what has been a very stressful experience has restored my faith that there are good people out there who are not only willing to help, but go the extra mile. My employer has agreed a settlement; I am not quite over the line yet and won’t believe it’s over till the paperwork is signed. But what I can and will shout from the roof tops I would never have got this far without Sam. I will be forever grateful for all the support you have given me Sam and the belief that I was in with a fighting chance of justice. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

If you are reading this testimonial, you, your story is likely to be similar to ours.  You have been treated disgracefully by your colleagues and employer and you are now feeling that you have nowhere to turn and no one can help you. It is a very lonely feeling and a very lonely place to be. But, this is where your story can change.
Reaching out to Sam Stone was the best decision we made.  We were on the verge of giving up and losing everything but that first phone call with Sam was a life changer. When the employer has thrown the kitchen sink and more at you, pause, message Sam and he will restore your faith and belief that what you are doing is right. Sam’s knowledge and understanding of Employment Law and legislation is extraordinary.  His passion for it is undeniable and his empathy towards his clients is heartfelt.  You begin your journey with Sam as a client, but he treats you as a friend and this is priceless. Our battle lasted 6 months and during that time, Sam lived through it with us, giving us not only his outstanding expertise and knowledge, but his time, support and guidance. If there is one person who is unquestionably on your side, it is Sam Stone. He is an absolute genius. His life is devoted to helping people like us fight the hardest of battles with our employers.
Sam kept us sane and gave us hope and faith throughout the whole process. He is the one person you need and possibly, (undoubtedly) the only person that will be able to navigate you through the stress and hassle that employers will put you through. We have won our battle and we did “sock it to them with much gusto”. But, without shadow of a doubt, we would not have done it without Sam.  He really is that good. And then some!!  Thank you Sam.  I hope you know how much we value that gifted mind of yours.  And we hope you know how much we value you as a friend, you ‘Evil Genius’. You are simply outstanding, nothing more can be said. Thank you.

As many of you here, I too found myself in a dispute with my employer. I was verbally assaulted by a male colleague at work and when I reported it to the manager she went to that colleague and complained to him about me and how it is not her job to deal with things like that. She also wanted to brush everything under the carpet and tried to discourage me from writing a grievance letter. I went off sick and having spoken to my friend who had similar experience, I contacted Sam as she recommended him to me.
I paid Sam £20 for a telephone consultation. We spoke and within a few minutes Sam articulated my grievances as direct and indirect sex discrimination, breach of trust and confidentiality and harassment. Sam didn’t promise anything, but he said if I used his grievance letter template that I would be definitely better off rather than if I wrote the grievance letter myself. I sent Sam my version of events and he spruced it up with legalese! That was amazing! Two days ago, my employer called me offering a settlement. The figure was not very big -£12,000 but I’m ok with that. Before I contacted Sam, I phoned a few solicitors for advice how to negotiate a settlement with my employer, but even with the solicitor’s advice my employer would not budge an inch.
I started feeling much better, calmer and stronger knowing that no matter what happens at least Im still being paid fully and can look for another job in the meantime. Now I just want to move on with my life and in my heart I know and they probably know too that I was right and it was best to pay me off to go. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I owe you so much and am beyond grateful for your help and that you were always so available and helpful.

Sam Stone is a living legend. I found Sam through Google, devoured the generous information on his website, and for the first time in months felt hope that I’d found a way forward. I’d been royally shafted by my highly experienced trade union representative and hung out to dry. I didn’t trust anyone anymore and had severe mental health problems.
At first, Sam Stone seemed too good to be true. I read dozens of testimonials before I plucked up courage to contact him. We arranged a telephone conversation, and from the outset I sensed that Sam was not only legit, but cared passionately about workplace harassment and discrimination, and his energy and commitment to the cause reinvigorated me. I regained my strength and decided to fight for my employment rights.
Sam warned me that public sector employers were difficult to predict and that I had to be prepared for a long slog. I should’ve listened to him, but I was naïve, having bought into all the propaganda that my employer peddled in glossy brochures and frequent newsletters. I believed they would take action against my harasser, given the substantial evidence I had against them.
I downloaded Sam’s grievance templates, wrote my grievance letter and a chronology which exceeded 30 pages. I then paid Sam to ‘pimp’ my letter and chronology, and he worked like a Trojan, tirelessly adding legal phrasing and case law examples. By the end of it, I thought my employer would quake in their boots.
They did, but unfortunately in my case, that meant they battened down the hatches and things got worse. Although I was spared the trauma of being interviewed in person by the grievance investigation, my employer took an extraordinary amount of time to produce its findings, and in the end, it was a whitewash. Denial, denial, denial. They ignored all of my evidence. I was stunned.
Sam, however, had expected this all along, and had continuously warned me it would go to appeal. And so, I paid Sam to write my appeal letter, and it was worth every penny. He also helped me communicate with my employer, creating a valuable evidence trail, which would later help me form the basis of my claims to the employment tribunal. He also assisted with my whistleblowing letters.
The quality of Sam’s work is second to none. He’s a wordsmith of the highest order, able to see through the smoke-and-mirrors, cutting through logical fallacies with scalpel-like precision. I was truly in awe of his ability to construct effective arguments in the written form.
Sam is a rare creature indeed, a kind and generous human being, and a man of towering intellect, with an ability to consume vast amounts of information and distil it down to its very essence. His service was incredible value for money, and I have no regrets whatsoever about my decision to work with him.
The appeal dragged on, and the outcome was another staggering whitewash. I contacted ACAS and commenced pre-claim conciliation, but no offer of settlement was made. From then on, I had to find legal representation to help me file my claim with the employment tribunal. As I write this, the journey hasn’t ended.
One year on from my first grievance letter, I’ve now quit the job which I absolutely loved and decided to go self-employed. I’ve been so traumatised by my experiences that I’m not able to contemplate returning to public sector work. I’ve found new paths forward and have no regrets about leaving my job behind.
Mine is a cautionary tale. The public sector is a law unto themselves, so if you work for them, you really must think long and hard about the personal repercussions of taking out a grievance and following my path.
I wish now that I’d woken up to smell the coffee sooner. I’d been bamboozled by my employer’s PR & Communications department, and like a sucker, had lapped it all up. I realise now that my chances of turning around the public sector oil tanker were incredibly small, and although I’m still fighting, I’m highly unlikely to achieve my goal of ‘justice’ and instead may have to settle for cold, hard money, in some form of settlement. And that’s only if all goes well.
I’ve recommended Sam to public sector colleagues. Indeed, many colleagues watched me walk this path and made their own (sensible) decision to simply find another job rather than fight for their rights. There’s now a mass exodus at my former workplace and very few applicants for their vacant posts. My post hasn’t been filled because they didn’t get any suitable applicants. Perhaps one day soon, my whistleblowing and the ever-increasing staff turnover will force my former employer to take action. Or perhaps not. Either way, I can hold my head up high.
Sam has been a superstar. He’s helped me regain my dignity and self-respect, both of which are priceless. Thanks, Sam. You truly are a legend.

It was by sheer happenstance that I fell upon Sam’s website. I was at such a low ebb and had been let down by solicitors and the unison. I was on high levels of medication and lost all ability to function in any meaningful way. I listened to the commentary on the website and looked at the testimonials, I then I took a leap of faith and rang Sam. Oh, gosh I am so glad I did. Sam’s knowledge and compassion are without equal. We discussed my grievances and within an hour’s Sam knew all of the issues and clarifying that he believed there had been a number of breaches of my statutory rights. There was no question he could help, which he did. Sam explained that as a reasonable person you want to be reasonable, but employers only want to mitigate the situation. Sam ripped my employer’s letters apart and put a stop to their bullying ways, I am not saying it’s not hard because it is, but Sam holds your hand throughout and is always at the end of a phone. My employer settled the case and I have since left and am recovering well.  I would not be in this position without Sam, I have never known anyone who can dissect a case in such a short time and really support you through it. It like having your own equaliser. The law is there for a reason and employers cannot ride roughshod over it, as there are consequences. If you need help this is definitely the person to contact, I have no hesitation in recommending him, and you have nothing to lose.

I stumbled across Sam’s page whilst frantically googling a minefield of information on raising a grievance/employment law at a time where I was feeling unnerved and trapped by my employer’s actions. I had a first chat with Sam who at the time, was an unknown entity to me and I quickly gained trust in his thorough knowledge and matter of fact attitude to getting things done – it was exactly what I needed.
With Sam’s expert guidance, I invoked grievance and whistleblowing procedures and began the long process. To date, we are at 16 months with several more to go, I am sure. I feel very different to the person who first googled ‘how to write a grievance’ all these months ago, and it is because I have had ‘Sam the Pitbull in my corner’. Together, we have challenged, protested and fought for equality/justice for my employer’s actions (age, sex, disability discrimination). The upshot has been my employer has been backed into a corner, with nowhere to go – the very way they made me feel.
The most important thing for me has been to keep my integrity, receive the answers to my many questions which surprise, surprise, my employer has been reluctant to do so when faced with the cold, hard facts of the law. I have had many sleepless nights owing to worry over pay, future career implications and where do I go from here. Sam has kept me sane, allowed me to keep the faith and encouraged me at a time where no one else could understand the magnitude and impact of taking on an employer. Do not underestimate the power of this if you are considering a similar process; it is alienating, and you need both an expert and a friend – that is Sam. I should finish by saying that because of Sam’s way with words, knowledge of the law and the vehement resolve to never, ever give up, I have not been put into financial purgatory as I feared. Remember upthread I mentioned my employer had been backed into a corner? They have continued to pay me (in full) during the process. This money has given me security and stability during the most challenging time in my career.
I am not the person I was when I began this process and as challenging as it has been, I feel my confidence and life skills have improved through the learning and many pep talks with Sam. I truly am incredibly grateful and would encourage anyone with any doubt to pick up the phone and find out for yourself.

I cannot recommend Sam highly enough and I cannot thank him enough for helping me achieve a highly satisfactory settlement agreement via the grievance procedures. Sam’s expertise with the grievance process together with his in-depth knowledge of legal cases relating to harassment, discrimination and victimisation made all of the difference in my grievance.  He pointed me in the right direction, he armed me with the right information and he gave me the confidence that I needed to take on a multi-million pound company and its legal advisers; I think we actually stunned them!  Without Sam’s help I would not have been able to achieve what I did. If you need help with a grievance, then look no further than Sam.

Discrimination does exist and its impact on people is profound and devastating.  In my case it was gradual over a number of years.  It is only now that I can attribute my deteriorated health and disability to the treatment I was subjected to.  I raised a grievance using online templates by a guy called Sam Stone and then looked down a cliff face of uncertainty and a profound feeling of loss of control.  What now?  Who do I trust? Who can help me?  Where will this end.
As a Muslim male I was deeply hurt and facing humiliation in front of my family and children.  Then I prayed to God for help and healing and decided templates were not enough, I needed to talk to Sam and I needed to fight with all I have.  Sam is a secret weapon, a one-man army and the architect of surgical strikes of devastating scale.  I know this because the grievances that followed were down to his expertise.  But how?  If you are in the position I was in, ring Sam Stone. Don’t delay a minute it could make the difference between a settlement agreement or being jobless.  I won and all was settled in my favour because of Sam.  Here are just five examples of how Sam helped me:
1- he systematically and methodically ripped apart the investigation reports and demonstrated that they were ambiguous and uncertain.
2 – he blew up the organisational logic and standards by demonstrating an abject failure and omission to undertake objective tests to reach conclusions on balance of probability being reported.
3 – he pinned down my employer on failures to respond to my specific questions which I did raise including the injury to my feelings.
4 – he blew the door off the hinges by demonstrating the investigation report by my employer was fundamentally flawed and ill-conceived as it failed to deal with my detailed observations on the investigation report.
5- he hammered the investigator on the basis that there had been an omission to apply sound conclusion challenging if the investigator was a  competent investigator having failed to apply reasonable skill and care.
Most of all Sam works all days and is always there 7 days a week.  He’s reliable, expertly informed and I am proud to say it feels like he is a family member.  If you don’t seek Sam’s help take it from me, you are making the biggest mistake of your life.  He really is a gattling gun in the face of lies, deceit, dirty tactics and shocking conduct.  I guarantee you will not make it through the grievance process on your own…get Sam he delivers and in bundles.  Watch your opponents fall to bits and learn some respect whilst your wounds heal.  Thank you Sam from the bottom of my heart and a 5 star review from me.

I came across Sam Stone’s website in a real panic, not realising that an email I had sent was not sufficient. Sam suggested I write a ‘formal grievance letter’.
Sam responded to my email within the hour of sending it on a Saturday night and a call was set up for the next morning.
After the call, I was reassured I was not making things up, it was the best £20 I have EVER spent. Sam’s expertise and guidance is what kept me sane throughout the whole grievance process – 4 month period.
I may not have won in the eyes of the company but let me tell you,Sam and I fought a good fight and as far as I’m concerned just making the company and the board director ‘stop and think’ about their actions for that split second is a win for me.
Sam, I can’t thank you enough for your guidance, support and patience throughout this process. From that Saturday night… you were my Knight in shining armour, for that I am forever grateful!

Having used the services of Sam previously in 2013/14 (after he was recommended by a family member, who had reached a very satisfactory settlement agreement in her case of pregnancy discrimination against her employer through the grievance procedures), we wouldn’t have trusted, or turned to anyone else, to provide assistance, especially when last year we found ourselves again, in an ongoing situation of discrimination, harassment and victimisation, on the grounds of disability and our marriage.
In 2013/14 Sam had helped us draft grievance letters, which grievance letters we believe ultimately led to us winning a tribunal case against our employer for discrimination, who is a government body.  At that time the employer turned up to court with three solicitors and two barristers. But it was too little too late. Sam had laid traps for them to walk into, which the solicitors and barristers could not dig the employer out of. The damage had already been done!
Fast forward to 2020 and we found ourselves in the worst possible scenario. Not only were we being subjected to worsening discriminatory treatment, that was almost beyond words and belief, but this time our legal expense insurer were only agreeing to fund ‘one’ of us, stating the other had no prospects of winning a case at tribunal. The insurer used the advice of an ‘independent’ barrister to turn down the claim and left us high-and-dry, stating the prospects were ‘less than 51%. Although Sam is not a solicitor, Sam suggested we got our own solicitor to take on the additional discrimination points the insurers would not pay for, which we did. Once the legal representation had been put in place to represent both of us in the Tribunal, we went on to ‘both’ reach in-court settlements at the tribunal. The settled claims were better than we expected and we have no doubt that this is because of Sam, who was clearly more in tune than our insurers barrister. With the greatest of respects, we hope we never have cause to call upon Sam’s services again in the future. But you can rest assured, he will be our ‘first port-of-call’ if we do! Thank you Sam from the bottom of our hearts.

I found myself in situation where my manager was actively trying to remove me from the company by hook or by crook. I was suspended pending an investigation, and my mental health took a decline. I spoke to my GP who immediately signed me off for Work Related Stress for 4 weeks. My employer while I was signed off tried to strong arm me into attending an investigation meeting. I spoke to ACAS, which didn’t fill me with any confidence and I didn’t feel any compassion from them. I went on to speak to Citizens Advice Bureau, who were very helpful and suggested putting in a grievance could be a good route to take.
This is where Sam Stone came into my life, I was searching for a template for a grievance letter and stumbled across his website. I can tell you I read every single page and discovered that due to the fact I suffer from Migraines and Anxiety I had a strong case for disability discrimination. But my case was complex so I reached out to Sam to see if he thought he could help me.
What a revelation that first conversation was, I was a little sceptical about paying the initial fee of £20 for Sam to have an initial telephone consultation with me – that scepticism disappeared within 30 seconds, and for the first time in a month I felt that I could take them on and win. We agreed that Sam would draft my grievance for me, and that evening it was sitting in my inbox followed up by a call from Sam telling me to pour a glass of wine before opening it.
The grievance can only be described as a work of art, it was 14 pages in length and it took me two sessions to even be able to read through it. It was incredibly hard hitting but to the point, factual and backed up with so many references to case law that no one could argue with it. I sent the little baby in the following day, and I can tell you I would have paid or done anything to have been a fly on the wall when it was opened.
The response to it was that the investigation was immediately stayed, and they employed a solicitor who answered the grievance. They rejected the grievance and omitted many of my requests for information.
Next, we put in an appeal that was 32 pages long, slamming them for not answering the questions we had asked and pushing even harder than before. Unsurprisingly the appeal was rejected, management had closed ranks. I can only assume they thought that was that – but no, straight on to ACAS and I placed three early conciliation claims against the company and members of management.
I’ve not had positive interactions with ACAS in the past, but I was assigned with a conciliator who listened to me thoroughly, contacted the individuals and the company. The company immediately inserted their solicitor, and negotiations began. While all this is happening a manager decided to restart the investigation and sent me over a list of questions to answer.
I drafted a response, and it was scathing; it tore the investigation completely to shreds. I questioned their methods of investigation pointed out how they weren’t following ACAS’s codes of conduct in a couple of matters. Sam tidied it up for me so it was presented in the same way as both the grievance and appeal, plus he added a bit of case law to really drive home the points I was making.
Very suddenly the company are very keen to settle, and push for a figure I go in high as you can’t negotiate up. For just over a week we played offer tennis, and today a figure has been agreed that will enable me to not have to go back into the workplace for nearly a year.
This has been the toughest five months of my life, it has seriously affected my mental health so much that I am now on medication. However as scary as that sounds, companies simply cannot get away with treating their employees fairly. With Sam’s expertise, sense of humour, unwavering dedication and pit bull personality when it comes matters like this. I am finally on the free knowing wounds are being licked on the other side. I will never know if the individuals who instigated the entire ordeal will ever be punished for what they have done to me – but karma has a very strange way of working.  If you are reading through the website, wondering if it is possible I can tell you hand on heart it most certainly is. Pick up the phone and get in contact, it will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.

After several years of keeping my head down, working hard and biting my tongue the unrelenting mental pressure of working in a toxic environment caused by my line manager took its inevitable toll on both my mental and physical health – both of which in an adverse way.
I knew something had to be done to stop this ever happening again. My colleagues had also become badly affected too and there was no way I was going to return to work and let this continue. Apart from it being morally wrong to just carry on as if nothing had happened,
I was convinced that my fellow colleagues could also be hospitalised like myself. What happened to me was the last straw. I got to the point that I was prepared to risk it all for the well being of myself, my colleagues and the whole company.
When you get pushed in to a corner there is only one choice and that is to fight back. Sam epitomises this and further to this he has an abundance of knowledge, tact, grit and determination. His whole attitude is to stand strong, make wrongs in to rights and to achieve justice.
Having researched the required procedures I then found Sam on the internet.  I read a couple of reviews, picked up the phone and introduced my predicament. Then the ball started to move. I sent Sam the grievance letter I had written and within an extremely short period of time Sam had reviewed it and beefed it up highlighting the relevant points of law and the breaches and that was it. Sam said ‘submit it’. In short the investigations took place and the grievance was upheld!. I’ve now been informed that my boss is not coming back!. This is exactly the outcome I was hoping for and it therefore enables me to return to work soon.
I have no doubt whatsoever that without Sams help and knowledge and the manner of the execution relating to my grievance and the appropriate laws, that this whole process was therefore taken very seriously by my employer and subsequently then resulted in maximum colleague corroboration in the investigations.
Sam is so good, this fight ended at the first hurdle. This is massive for me. My colleagues are delighted and can’t wait for me to return. I stay in my employment and I personally will be able to start enjoying my life generally again. So thank you very much Sam.
I hope I don’t have to go through anything like this again but if I do, or if I know anyone else with a similar predicament, I promise I’ll recommend you to them. If you’re reading this and need any help look no further than Sam. Pick up the phone and you will not regret it.
I wish you all the best with everything Sam and have a great summer.
Thanks Ronny

I cannot recommend Sam Stone enough. Sam helped me through a very dark & stressful time with my employers at work, for two years my mental well-being had been greatly affected along with my confidence. With Sam’s expertise & extensive knowledge I come away with a fair & substantial settlement and I can hold my head up high again, I won! Communication was always fantastic, Sam really did fight my corner and I will always be grateful to him.
Warmest regards,

If you’re reading this, I know exactly how you feel at the moment. It wasn’t long ago I was in your position, searching for a solution and ending up on this very page. Reading through the numerous testimonials gave me the confidence that contacting Sam was the right decision; and I am extremely grateful that I did. I was admittedly quite nervous about initiating the grievance process, but Sam guided me through every step, laying out a plan from start to finish. He built back some of my confidence by providing the reassurance that he was fighting in my corner, using all of his experience to ensure that I could take the initiative to achieve a desirable outcome. We can only hope that as employees we may only encounter this scenario once in our career. The reality is that these situations do happen often, which means Sam has the experience and the speciality from successfully handling many grievances. This is abundantly clear from the outset and proven throughout, as he took the time to ensure I understood the relevant laws and their implications to my situation. Simply put, Sam Stone is the best possible resource to navigate your grievance procedure and I absolutely recommend that you reach out to him if you believe you may need to explore this route. He is genuine, caring, and professional and I cannot thank him enough. I am confident you will share this sentiment should you require his services.”

If you are visiting this page wondering whether to utilise Sam Stones services, then do not hesitate any further.  I can guarantee that it will be money well spent and will save your sanity, improve your wellbeing, and take the pressure off trying to manage the grievance process alone. Prior to contacting Sam, I sought advice from my union who were sympathetic but did not actually offer any advice.  I also contacted several solicitors who were unsympathetic, did not see any strength in my case and were only interested in supporting if I went to tribunal.
Furthermore, I could not afford their ridiculous rates. Let me share some of my story.  I am sure you will be able to relate given that you are reviewing Sam’s page and testimonials. My journey is unfortunately a familiar scenario.  I was long serving and successful in a senior role when I suddenly found myself a victim of discrimination, bullying & harassment and being managed out of the business by new management. The treatment triggered my mental health issues, and I went from being a confident high achiever to a shadow of my former self nervous, anxious & depressed.  I worked long hours under extreme pressure.  I had no work life balance but nothing I ever did was right.  How could this be happening to me?  I could not see the wood for the trees and eventually I had a complete mental breakdown and was signed off work by my doctor. My plan was just to use my time off to look for another job and exit the business quietly.  However, once I had time away from the toxic environment, I had time to reflect.  I COULD NOT let them get away with this.  I had to fight back.  So, I wrote my grievance letter which was written from an emotional perspective.  I contacted my union who were sympathetic and advised me to send it – thank goodness I did not follow their advice. I was worried, I knew if I was going to fight back, I had to get it right, so I spent hours scrolling the internet.
I came across Sam’s page, read some testimonials, and decided to purchase a grievance template.  However, I had multiple grievances & I knew I needed further support, so I contacted Sam directly.  On our first phone call he put me at ease and gave me confidence that we CAN beat the bullies.  We just need to know how to do it which is where Sam took over.  I instructed Sam to write my chronology and grievance letter.  It was amazing, so good in fact that it took my employer months to provide me with an outcome.  Unfortunately, not a single grievance was upheld and instead the outcome detailed numerous untruths about me from my employer to defend their case. I was destroyed and depressed.  What had I done?  I thought to myself I should have just walked away quietly as I had originally planned.
However once again, a call to Sam gave me the strength to continue the fight and I instructed Sam to write my appeal which was a work of art.  Sam expertly recognises where the employer has made serious errors and articulately challenges and references these errors to the points of law outlining how the grievance outcome was misconceived.  I was hoping for a quick turnaround from my employer, but they kept us waiting for a substantial period of time.  Eventually after months the fight was over, and my employer agreed to settle. During those dark days and months, I obsessed over Sam’s website. I read every article and testimonial praying that one day I would be writing my own and now here I am.  I can never thank Sam enough for all the support and guidance spanning over months and months.  Without Sam I would have had no chance of achieving a successful outcome and settlement.  Sam has restored my faith in human nature, given me back my self-confidence and most importantly I now have my freedom to move on with the rest of my life. Thank you, Sam Stone.

What can say about Sam Stone … let’s just say if you are looking at his page, your situation like mine has taken its toll. Do not leave this page without speaking to Sam i promise you will not regret it. Sam saw me through the worse time in my career and life. He fought my corner on everything they threw at me bullying, harassment, unlawful victimisation, discrimination and to top it off a disciplinary. Sam’s knowledge beats that of any employment solicitor I spoke to, his letters are exceptional and they packed a punch. For me it was having Sam at the end of the phone when I was struggling with my mental health, I was hanging on by a thread. I can never thank Sam enough, you do not come across humans like Sam very often absolute god send. Thanks Sam

Hopefully, most of you are fortunate not to find yourself in a situation where a toxic manager or employer is victimising, bullying or harassing you and are unsure what to do or who to turn to? I am grateful that I Googled ‘raise grievance letter’ and came across Sam’s website.
I initially looked at purchasing a template letter – after watching the video and reading through the very helpful information relating to employment law and the structure the letter should form. However, I decided that it would be far better to engage Sam’s services, especially where the situation at work was becoming untenable. In my thirty-year career, I have never found myself under an employer with a new manager whose campaign of bullying, harassment and victimisation influenced my asthma and caused endless nights of worry, stress and anxiety.
I decided to contact Sam in regards to helping me with the grievance and was nervous about making the first PayPal payment, as I had never met or dealt with Sam previously. My worries were unfounded and it was the best decision I made. I found Sam to be open, honest and very knowledgeable from the initial phone call. He listened to my situation, drafted an e-mail for me to send to my employer over the phone, in order to provide us with some time to submit the grievance letter and chronology.
I had no experience of such issues and found it re-assuring to know Sam was on hand and supported me through the whole process – from writing the grievance letter, grievance interview, Occupation Health meeting, grievance appeal, until a settlement agreement was drawn up by ACAS, which I was happy with. The process lasted over seven months from start to finish, but what I can say was Sam was always diligent and replied or called back with next steps or a plan of action and without this, I believe I would not be on the road to recovery with my health today and am thankful to him for his commitment and care.
You can be assured that you are in safe, competent hands with Sam on your side; He will surely give your employer and HR departments a run for their money. I was fortunate that I came across Sam’s website. He is a genuinely, kind person who wishes to ‘do right’ by those facing challenges with their employers.  Thank you Sam. I am truly grateful for all your assistance, help and calming influence during the stressful times my employer put me through. I can now put that behind me and move forward with my life.
Take care and god bless you.

Dear Sam Stone,
I put in writing my thanks to you as a testimonial with an enormously deep appreciation and immense expression of gratitude to you for assisting me with my extremely complex employment workplace matter surrounding i.e. health and safety contraventions, serious wrongdoing amounting to gross misconduct by senior managers, breach of mutual trust and confidence, intentional deceit to undermine the grievance/appeal/investigation process and outcomes, multiples breaches of good faith, unlawful suspension, race discrimination, victimisation, unfair treatment, harassment, abuse of power/authority, defamation of character, malicious and vexatious allegations against me that compromised my employer’s position and placed them in disrepute.
My grievances were not by any means an easy matter to review, understand and manoeuvre around legally as challenging a FSTE 100 company with billions behind them is an enormous task especially for a sole Individual. Liaising with you was a flawless activity, your knowledge of employment law and remarkable case law precedents are equivalent to Solicitors and Barristers in the magic circle law firms for a fraction of their prices. Your expertise permitted me to run rings around so-called pricey top calibre lawyers that proved no match for your many years of experience. Adhering to your recommendations assisted me to make the absolute best decision pertaining to my employment. From day one, our very first telephone meeting, I knew that we had a chance at winning this thing, I felt relieved, and fortunately for myself, this proved to be true. I realise that this was not the easiest grievance to win and that you were required to spend long hours drafting my responses with collating caselaw to support my grievances. It is for this that I thank you. You treated me just as well, if not better than most prestigious law firms would. It was never about money with you but simply attaining the best results for your clients. In fact, I was not prepared for the kindness and consideration I received from you. It was not all ‘business’ with you, it was something more personal, a great sense of passion to do the ‘right thing’ by me your client. This made me feel secure with your immaculate handling of my case.
Thanks to your expertise and prowess, my grievances not only saw the light of day at the highest level the organisation (C-Suite) but were resolved with one of the biggest settlements I could have ever hoped for in the upper Vento band which was paid out in record time. Due to all your assistance and outstanding expertise, I feel ‘Justice’ was served. Your dedication, your attention to detail and diligence made this all possible. You believed in me and my situation and did not wavier, but remained steadfast through it all, even when my employer was trying to be problematic. In the end, it all worked out well. Thank you for not only being my employment consultant but also becoming my friend through this exceedingly difficult process that caused me an enormous amount of stress and anxiety; you were there at every given stage (morning, noon and evenings too). I appreciate the attention extended to my health and wellbeing, as does my family. All of us wish to extend to you, our utmost friendship and hope that you consider yourself an extended member of our family, and if there is anything, I (we) can do for you, simply ask.

I am a highly experienced HR Business Partner who found herself in a nightmare situation with her employer.  It was ugly, unfair, and had all the hallmarks of discrimination and victimisation.  I spent 8 weeks trying to sort the matter out for myself before paying over £600 for two hours of a Solicitor’s time to assess the case.  While he agreed that the whole scenario sounded suspicious, he advised me to give up because it would be unlikely I’d win (‘employers have more resources than you do’).
I was at my wit’s end…I knew that I could win, that the organisation could and should be challenged, and that I’d never forgive myself if I didn’t try.  I remembered Sam from a few years previous – he had helped me in a separate case – and so I tentatively laid my grievances before him.  Sam took charge immediately and went straight to the heart of the matter in a way I could not – by then I was suffering with depression and anxiety.  My fight with the employer went on for 9 long months but from the time Sam started assisting me the tide turned. The employer continued to fight me but Sam was there every step of the way, even accompanying me to two meetings with the employer.
Not only was he there to draft in-depth and robust responses to everything the employer threw at me, he coached and encouraged me every step of the way.  He was highly responsive to me throughout, even during a period he was coping with a difficult family situation.  On the few occasions he couldn’t get back to me immediately, he let me know when he would be able to – I was never left dangling or wondering.  Therefore, at a time of great uncertainty and distress, I knew I could trust Sam, that he would not let me down, and he hasn’t. Sam’s grasp of employment law around discrimination, bullying, harassment etc is, in my view, second to none.  He demonstrates a depth of knowledge that would be hard to match.
He certainly gave my employer’s solicitor a run for her money.  As such I am now in the happy position of reaching settlement with my employer with a package that clearly recognises that they are not confident of what the outcome would be should I take the matter to the Employment Tribunal. In short, I can’t recommend Sam Stone highly enough.  He has proven to me, not once, but twice that he truly knows his stuff, is trustworthy, reliable, quick on his feet, and is passionate about helping those that employers try to ‘do over’.  If Sam believes you have been wronged, then he goes all out.

Sam absolutely saved me as I was about to lose my job and I had been pushed into a dark hole that I couldn’t get out of alone.  Sam was extremely busy, yet he made time for me and took me through my work’s grievance procedure, Sam always had time for me in our correspondence and he managed to make my employers realise the error of their ways through his superb work; in doing so they increased their initial settlement offer to me tenfold.  If you need help with your grievance, Sam is your go to person, he has been in the same situation, so he has enormous understanding of the predicament of his clients.  I am so very grateful for all of Sam’s help during a very low point in my life, I couldn’t have got there without Sam. Thank you Sam so much for helping me.

I can recall only too vividly that moment earlier this year when I knew I had to fight back. I did not know where to turn for help and knew that I could not afford the services of a solicitor. I scoured the web looking for resources, whilst I managed to come up with some relevant information it was not enough to instil confidence in taking on my employer on my own. During my searches, I stumbled upon Sam Stones
www.letterofgrievance.com
and decided to take a chance by purchasing one of the template letters. The template was so thorough and expertly written that I knew with some tweaking it could be adapted to my needs.  Furthermore, so impressed with the quality of the template received, I was spurred to call Sam and ask for his direct assistance. I am so glad I did. Sam knew exactly what I was going through both on an emotional level and practical level, he is approachable and always makes time to talk matters through with you when you need it, staying at least two moves ahead of the opposition. Sam’s knowledge of employment law and practices of HR departments is second to none. Immediately in receiving Sam’s expert guidance and well-crafted letters I felt like the tables had turned and that I was on the front foot. My former employer made an offer of settlement. I would urge without hesitation anyone going through a dispute with your employer to have a conversation with Sam to see how he can help you in your specific circumstances. Not only did I immediately feel a vast improvement in my mental health from working with Sam, but I can also say that without hesitation that the end result would not have been the same without his assistance.

Sam has been a godsend over the last year whilst I have been on sick leave. He has written a few formal grievance letters for me on the subject of disability discrimination. His letters are amazing and I’ve achieved a swift response from management when I have sent a grievance composed by Sam. I had been at the end of my tether with the wall of silence from management until I discovered Sam Stone. His letters are very well written and Sam is very knowledgeable. Thanks to Sam, I am now back at work after a year’s sick leave with all the support I need. I was also facing capability proceedings at work but thanks to a letter devised by Sam, the capability proceedings were dropped when management realised that their approach amounted to disability discrimination. I would recommend Sam Stone to anyone. He has been more helpful in achieving results than my Union representative.

Having had many sleepless nights, I tentatively called Sam one day for some help on my son’s bullying manager. I knew we needed to act, had already spoken with a solicitor but was still unsure on the best approach to take. In the first call, Sam carefully laid out his initial thoughts and it was a relief to be speaking with him – he was really easy to talk to, seemed honest, trustworthy, energetic and mentally on it….but could I be sure? Under no pressure, I knew I had a choice – to pursue our case with his help, or to go it alone. With some trepidation, I went with my gut instinct, sent him a payment and the ball was rolling.
Our first letter hit the company with some significant force, subsequent letters delivered expertly-crafted responses and challenges, and Sam became our expert guide through these highly challenging waters, predicting how events would unfold and always remaining a step ahead. Don’t underestimate the employer’s response. Even in the most high-profile companies, there are policies that mean nothing more than the paper they’re written on, HR departments who are robotic, nowhere near innovative, and seemingly set up to make things as difficult as possible at every stage.
The world seems to be going completely mad. However, there are times in life when you must stand up and fight back, for yourself as well as others. It takes guts, time and perseverance and you may think you don’t have the fight in you. Gather your courage, enlist Sam’s help and take them on. The road will be tough, but I can honestly say there is nobody better to have by your side. Sam’s definitely your man!

I was unfairly made redundant in the middle of the Covid-19 Pandemic. I had a serious dispute with my employer prior to the pandemic, but the pandemic proved to be a useful excuse for HR to eliminate my position. Sam assisted in writing a grievance, grievance appeal and to some extent the redundancy appeal. Though I didn’t get my job back, the grievances and appeals started laying a paper trail of the company’s misdeeds that led directly to the employment tribunal. This forced their hand to settle with me and I was awarded a sum of money that will keep me afloat until years’ end. Sam has assisted me with four different employment disputes over the past 8 years; with two of those disputes being with the same employer. By using his templates and asking him to write bespoke letters to my employers, I have benefited substantially. I showed my employers that I wasn’t a push-over and that their bad treatment of me was out-of-order. I showed my employers that if they come for me, I am not afraid to litigate this out. I have won every employment dispute, thanks to Sam. In financial terms, over 8 years I have been awarded £95,000. This is all down to Sam helping me. I want to stress that this is not about the money. It’s about justice and employers following the law. The money simply helps forward with your life. Thank you, Sam, for all your help!

Strategy, knowledge, support and confidence. That’s what you need to win and Sam brings it by the bucket load!! This gentleman who somehow swallowed a dictionary & law library is the smart, tactical raging bull that you need in your corner to power boost your fight. He became my shield, sword and missing knowledge base that equipped me with the confidence and support that I was in dire need of. I am so grateful to have had Sam on my side, he is what my solicitor should have been like… A genuine strategic machine who’s not shy to call out BS when it’s present (done in a highly professional manner don’t worry)!  Do yourself and your family a favour, less the stress you’re feeling, remove that guilt you’re hiding knowing that you’re burdening your spouse with your anxiety/stress, get that bounce back in your step and ease the sleepless nights. Give him a call, he’s to the point, knows how to handle the opposition and most importantly he himself has actually been through what you are feeling.
It’s the first time I went through a Grievance and in my view, there’s a fundamental flaw in HR practices where there’s blatant unfairness to the employee. I still can’t believe how sneaky it all is – believe it, they absolutely count on the fact of how unknowledgeable you are of employment law and it’s this that massively degrades your chances of a fair grievance process. Until there’s a shakedown in HR practices in general (never going to happen), whereby they should in fact actually look after any employee equal to looking after their management team, then people like Sam are a godsend for us. Sam is a solid powerhouse of knowledge that stands in your corner as a friend who knows his thing, takes action with laser-sharp precision and nails it!!  Oh, and one last thing, he is lightning fast with responding to your texts/emails. Cheers Sam, you fantastic human being!

If you have a grievance, YOU NEED SAM! I have successfully used Sam twice now and I recommend that you do too. You will no doubt be under pressure, have a sense of injustice and don’t know how to get out of it. You can have a go yourself but the chances are, your employer will dismiss everything and you’ll end up possibly out of a job. This is where Sam comes in. Your approach will be based on events, Sam’s approach is based on employment law. This is where Sam has got your back and your employer will not know what has hit them. Sam is a really approachable chap and will put you at ease within minutes. I also suggest that you get Sam to write your letters. Alternatively, several times, I have written the letter myself and sent it on to Sam. He fine tuned my letters and worded it to the points of law. Your employer will be shocked and no doubt, dig themselves an even deeper whole. You will also feel relieved with Sam on board, if your employer dismisses things further, like what happened to me, then Sam will be prepared or expecting it. This will dig them even deeper and your employer will know that they are on the rocks, when you appeal through Sam. My employer has just settled out of court and I owe Sam great credit; for what he wrote to the point of law, had armed my legal team to the teeth and my employer knew it. Sam will teach you and your employer a great deal about employment law and he will fight your corner better than anyone! Speak to Sam, you are in good hands.

I was having a very difficult period at work and had already researched Sam’s website, reading his testimonials confirmed to me I should make contact with him. His response was immediate, his grasp of the situation astounded me and within 30 minutes of consulting with him I invoked the grievance process against my employer. I was petrified about doing so, but with Sam working every step of the way alongside me, I felt more confident.
I would advise anyone going through a similar situation to involve Sam Stone because he will support, motivate and encourage you throughout this horrendous process. I enlisted Sam to write a bespoke grievance letter, along with writing every other response to the bullying correspondence I encountered. He was always at the other end of the phone to chat through the next steps, or simply to counsel and support me through the decision making process.
By the time I had reached the appeal process, after receiving a sham outcome to my grievances, I enlisted Sam to write my appeal letter. What an appeal letter it was; 48 pages of pure and utter brilliance! My employer never heard my appeal, 24 hours after they received it they were wanting to settle with me.
However, after enlisting a Solicitor to draw up a settlement agreement, my employer  made me a few appalling financial offers, all which I declined. Losing confidence after being informed the third would be their ‘final offer’ I decided to employ a Barrister to assess the merits of my case should it proceed to an employment tribunal. Firstly, he congratulated me on the outstanding grievance and appeal letter’s, expressing how well I had researched employment law, (thanks Sam) and secondly, he affirmed I certainly had merits to pursue a claim in the employment tribunal. Armed with a new found confidence, I gave my employer their ‘final offer’. I need not have worried, 24 hours later my employer was offering me a substantial settlement which I accepted.
I would encourage anyone going through a similar predicament to remain strong willed throughout the whole process; it’s certainly not for the feint hearted. I would also encourage you to employ the services of Sam Stone. Without doubt, he was instrumental in securing my final outcome, and as he said to me very early on, “it’s a game of snakes and ladders, I will make sure we are always at the top of the ladder.”

I came across Sam’s website after suffering a campaign of bullying, harassment and victimisation at the hands of an inappropriately behaved line manager. I turned from a successful and ambitious senior leader with a bright future ahead of me, to becoming an utter wreck, suffering with stress and all the other symptoms that an intimidating work environment brings; anxiety, panic attacks, sleepless nights and depression.
Within a short period of time, I felt my world collapse around me and needed help and support. I will never forget the first phone call I had with Sam. He instantly recognised and articulated the serious breaches to my employment rights that I was encountering and reassured me he would be with me every step of the way. I was at a low ebb and needed someone to take control; that’s where Sam becomes a godsend. I am so glad I did everything Sam suggested during the initial consultation. He predicted things would turn for me very quickly and he was right. Within 30 minutes of invoking a grievance to HR, I was sent a letter requiring me to attend a disciplinary meeting about my own conduct! From that moment onwards, I enlisted Sam to write my grievance letters and he continued to assist me with responding to all the bullying emails I received from my employer throughout the past 5 months.
Despite how scared you might be feeling, Sam’s expertly written letters will have you, eventually, laughing out loud because he knows how to beat unscrupulous employers at their own game. The investigation into my grievances were (as Sam predicted) totally brushed under the carpet and covered up. Feeling a burning sense of injustice at seeing the true extent of how employers ‘cover up’ inappropriate behaviour made me feel strong and empowered – they were not getting away with destroying my career. Sam wrote me a genius, 50 page appeal letter. Within 24 hours of my employer receiving that letter, I was asked to enter into a ‘without prejudice’ discussion about settling and exiting the organisation. I am confident, armed with the grievance and appeal letters Sam provided me, my employer will agree to a settlement figure I will be content with. I cannot begin to thank Sam for all the help, guidance, support and wealth of knowledge he provided to me throughout this horrendous period. Every text message or phone call that you make to Sam will be responded to, no matter how insignificant it may be to you whilst your confidence is knocked. Sam will never make you feel irrelevant, he really does fight your corner and I would not have got through the process without him on my side. If you find yourself in an unfortunate position due to being bullied at work, contact Sam Stone, he truly is an expert in employment law.

I’ve been back at work now for more than 9 months and recently got a bonus award for good work. This is far cry from where I was a year ago. I work for a large organisation and, this may sound like a familiar story. A new manager, piled on the work and decided I was incompetent, difficult to manage and, following a minor argument, reported me up the line for abusive behaviour. He kindly provided me with a dreadful end of year report which was negative, inaccurate and unfair. I went on sick leave, only to return to find that from the ‘evidenced based report’ HR had decided to put me on a PIP for poor performance with a warning that if there was no improvement, dismissal was a possibility.
I would point out that I have worked for said organisation for more than 10 years with good reports and no record of abusive behaviour. I went back on sick leave for clinical depression which lasted for a year. During this time, I felt I needed professional help to get me out of this hole, I trawled the internet and found Sam’s amazing site.  Could this be the answer? I called him and we had long chat.  Sam explained to me the contraventions of my statutory rights by threatening to terminate my employment if I did not return to work.  I paid Sam to write me a bespoke grievance letter, and wow what an amazing hard-hitting product he provided with page upon page of legal evidence backed up with case law. At first, I was disappointed as neither the grievance nor the follow up appeal were upheld, they closed ranks and fabricated everything to support their case, although much of it seemed desperate. I was at rock bottom and on half pay. But rather out of the blue there was a sudden turnaround. I was invited to a mediation meeting, told that the bullying manager had been moved on and that I could start again afresh with no recriminations. It worked, everyone has been great, my new manager is supportive and all references to PIPs and disciplinaries have been dropped. A line has been drawn under the whole process; I’m even enjoying work again.
If it hadn’t been for Sam and his tough (and I mean tough) approach I may well have been managed out of the organisation. The result has been a ‘win, win’, the best outcome!

When that first PayPal request came over, I was really nervous. Was this just a big con? Was it right to send money to someone I barely knew over the internet? But on the other hand – the phone calls I had with Sam were fantastic. He’d spent time explaining things to me and allowing me to share my experiences. He seemed like he really knew what he was talking about. Despite it feeling like a big risk, I bit the bullet and transferred over my payment to Sam and wow am I pleased I did! I can barely put into words how fantastic Sam has been.
My grievance / performance case was already quite complex. I’d been subjected to all sorts of bullying, harassment and intimidation at the school I worked at, and that all continued and worsened through the grievance process. I was worried that it would be too complex for Sam to pick up at such a late stage and with the uniqueness of the education sector, which is very different to other industries; I thought it was a big ask. Sam picked it up immediately! We’d had a couple of phone call conversations and Sam knew straight away that my case wasn’t a simple bullying case. He immediately identified that I’d blown the whistle for the health and safety of staff and pupils at the school, which I was being victimised for and Sam believed they were discriminating against me on grounds of my disability. I was already exhausted from fighting; my union was not supporting me properly and I was on the verge of giving up, or cracking up. Sam took control, which was exactly what I needed to remove the pressure. He reassured me and wrote letters for me to send to my employer.
I put my faith entirely in Sam and I’m so pleased I did. He told me at the beginning that he was like a Rottweiler and that once he took on my case, he wouldn’t let go! And my goodness was that true! I never had to wait for a reply to my emails. If I received a nasty email from my employer and I went into meltdown mode, I’d forward it on to Sam and within a few hours, he sent a well-crafted, expertly written letter for me to send back to my employer – leaving them under no illusions that I was not to be messed with. Any mistake they made, Sam picked it up and threw it back at them with a punch of dynamite. It’s not about being rude or belligerent; it’s about using the laws that are in place to protect employees. It’s about stopping these bullies from running roughshod over you. What Sam doesn’t know about employment law and equality law is not worth knowing. He’s like a walking and talking encyclopaedia of case law, which he can recall precisely and immediately at any given moment. If the employer does something to you, Sam can refer to the legal Acts & Regulations and back it up with case law to boot. As I regained my confidence, I began to research the law myself. I wanted to understand exactly what all the letters meant, and Sam was more than happy to spend time explaining it to me. He was happy for me to ask questions and give my input into the letters we were sending. Sam attended my grievance appeal hearing as my companion and I honestly could not have managed without him there. There are so many things that I can say about Sam and how he has helped me, but the thing that stands out the most for me is that he empowered me. From someone who had been bullied and battered into submission, he helped me to regain my confidence and continue the fight. Sam has become a real friend to me through this and I honestly can’t thank him enough. Thanks Sam! My mum and husband have said thank you too for everything you’ve done.

I stumbled across Sam’s website having gone through a lengthy campaign at work for bullying, harassment and disability discrimination.  I had gone from a strong and independent woman who had worked hard to solely raise two children, pursue a degree and build a solid career to a broken women contemplating suicide.  From the initial conversation over the telephone, Sam listened patiently to my experience(s) and very quickly explained what was happening and how my employer had been discriminating against me. For the first time in over a year I felt listened to, understood and knew I had a met somebody who was knowledgeable in employment law and most importantly would fight tooth and nail on my behalf. I asked Sam initially to write my first grievance letter and he assisted me with responding to every letter from my employer ever since.  It has been quite a journey and I could not have done any of it without Sam’s patience, knowledge and hard work to scrutinise every letter my employer sent.  I have been on sick leave for a year and with Sam’s help have received full pay during my time off.  I am still awaiting resolution with my employer, however, armed with the six grievance letters Sam has put together, I am confident my employer will agree a settlement figure that I will be content with.If you are reading this testimonial, considering whether or not to use Sam’s services, do not hesitate because you honestly won’t regret it. THANK YOU Sam for EVERYTHING.

After suffering at the hands of a new manager for several months, never being able to do anything right in her eyes, being micro managed to the extreme and then placed on a PIP, it became very clear that she had an agenda and that was to push me out of the company I had been at for over 12 years. Up to this point it had been a very successful career. Foolishly looking back, I believed that HR would not allow her to act this way. I soon learnt that HR is not there to support the employees it is there to protect the company. HR proceeded to fail me on the PIP despite the objectives they set being met, then jumped steps in their own process to give me a written warning. It was at this point I hit the panic button as I realised I needed professional help.
I emailed Sam Stone on a Sunday, briefly explaining my situation, his response was swift despite being at a family function. We chatted on the Monday and agreed a plan of action. Every action the company made from this point was met by Sam and a better reaction, the company started to dig themselves a hole. It was clear that my job could not be saved and I had no wish to stay working for the Boss that had made my life so miserable, she had turned me into an anxious and depressed mess, something I never could have foreseen prior to this manager. I was now fighting to exit the company on my terms, with a settlement that reflected the years of service and high level of effort I had given. With Sam’s knowledge of employment law, a few strongly worded letters, followed by the raising of a grievance against both my manager and HR and appealing the PIP decision, HR decided an off the record discussion on potential terms for me to leave the company should now take place. I have now come away from an extremely toxic scenario with an agreed settlement, which will now allow me time to find a new company and rebuild my career. The alternative would have been a disaster for my health and the wellbeing of my family. I am truly grateful for everything that Sam did for me, I certainly could not have done that without him.

I honestly can’t put into words how grateful I am that I found Sam! I had been treated so badly at work and my company was insistent in completely whitewashing my grievances. I was ready to just give up. Solicitor were quite frankly useless and were telling me that I didn’t have enough evidence. Sam was was saviour and tower of strength! He knows the law more than anyone I know and put the solicitors I had spoken to, to shame! He gave me hope when I was so low and his encouragement and support was unwavering. I reached an amazing settlement figure without the need for a tribunal along with a good reference. Sam I cannot thank you enough.

Sam is simply fantastic.  I came across his website and engaged his assistance after I was subject to discrimination at work. As a more junior lawyer myself (but not a specialist within employment law) I can say that he is extremely knowledgeable with respect to the relevant case law and legislation. He is a good strategist, knows how to beat unscrupulous employers at their own game, fantastic when it comes to helping you fight your corner and also a really good moral support. Had I not enlisted his support I very much doubt I would have achieved the outcome that exceeded my expectations. If you need help with any stage of the grievance process – don’t hesitate in contacting Sam Stone – he’s your man!

Where do I start!! There aren’t enough words to describe the sincere gratitude that I have for Sam Stone. Following a very devastating health diagnosis, I was faced with a very slow and long recovery. It was a very difficult and challenging time for my loved ones and I. At the time, I thought that I had the most caring and compassionate employers and could not wait to get back to work. The process of getting back to work, after long term absence due to ill health, started to prove virtually impossible and very quickly my relationship with my employers deteriorated. Not only did I have the debilitating, daily battle of my recovery, I had to deal with bullying, work pressure, victimisation and disability discrimination.
I was absolutely devasted because all I wanted, was to have a fair chance of returning to work. It had affected my physical and mental well-being, barely able to get out of bed some days, crying endless tears. By the time I stumbled across Sam Stone I was at my lowest point and had very little confidence/fight left in me.
I emailed Sam during the weekend and he responded immediately, and a consultation call was made from the following day (Sunday). I was so impressed that Sam was willing to speak to me out-of-hours. From that call, everything changed for me. It was like a fire was ignited within me! Everything that Sam mentioned to do with the breaches of employment law was incredible. I was totally oblivious about how serious and strong my grievances were and the magnitude of violations that were happening in-front of my very eyes, but I was just too weak and tested to see it clearly.
Sam created the most profound, impactful, mind-blowing masterpiece of a grievance letter being nearly 70 pages long. I had never felt so determined, stronger than ever to carry on with this fight. The references, extracts that were taken from different sources of documentation that I had provided Sam with, was out-standing. I just could not grasp how he managed to put together the pieces of the jigsaw into a case so undeniably strong. I felt every word of what he said! I felt the anger! It made me even more determined to ensure that justice would be served on my terms!
Sam supported me every step of the way. There was never a time that he wasn’t responsive to my panicked emails, calls or texts. He just has a great way of reassuring you and has a wonderful ability in enabling you to see things clearly! He lifted my spirits with his humbling & very direct manner. He is very to the point, which was exactly what I needed to get me through such a devastating process. He made me feel like I was in a safe place again and to keep up the fight because it would be worth it.
Sam provided me with hope that I honestly thought I had lost and could never have imagined in a million years that I would have been able to gain so much strength, fierceness and drive! I gained incredible amounts of self-confidence. I’ve found pride within myself again and Sam truly helped me achieve more than just the satisfaction of ‘settling’ with my employers out of court! I’m no longer a prisoner to my employers, the new sense of Freedom I now have, is just incredible. With Sam’s help, I can now focus on my recovery and look forward to all the positive experiences, I will embark on.
Sam, thank you for all that you do. You’re truly a blessing and a wonderous force of fire!
Warmest wishes, always
A very grateful heart

I can only describe there being some form of divine intervention that made me contact Sam. Like many people, I stumbled across his website after googling how to raise a grievance against my employer. I suspected that I would need his help as I anticipated that my Plan A – an informal chat with my employer in the hope they’d pay me to go away quietly – would fail. Incidentally, this POA was suggested to me by a Solicitor.
With hindsight, it would have failed spectacularly and put me on the back foot and with no further cards to play. Sam clocked this immediately and didn’t shy away from telling me so. At the time, having psyched myself up to carryout Plan A, I felt deflated but that quickly evaporated after Sam outlined what I needed to do and why.  After a telephone consultation with Sam the next day, I put together a chronology supported by evidence. Sam explained the need to shift the burden of proof and whilst I knew in my mind what had been going on, Sam explained that I may have to convince a court of law in the event the matters escalated to the Employment Tribunal. Whilst I’m not unfamiliar with this concept, the hardest thing for me was seeing the wood for the trees and what evidence was key and what was ancillary. That’s where Sam comes in. He drafted a grievance letter which cleverly articulated my employer’s failings and backed them into many corners. I say this now, as even I didn’t realise the knots he was tying them up in until later!
My Employer’s initial response feigned concern but that changed when I finally got the grievance outcome. Naively I’d hoped that they would at least hold their hands up and put right the wrongs, but they simply did not uphold my grievances. I was reeling but Sam brought me back down to earth and we set about the appeal. 80 pages of pure genius! The knots tightened and their incompetence shone through after Sam tore through their responses. I never did get a response to my appeal as my Employer agreed to settle. Whilst I’m intrigued to know how they might have responded, I now know that it was a means to an end. If you engage Sam Stone you get a strategist and tactician with an encyclopaedic legal brain which is akin to a barrister. His commitment to you, his client, is second to none and goes beyond what you’d normally expect. You also get a friend who will preserve your dignity throughout and treat you with compassion and respect. Sam, you’re a legend. We’re eternally grateful for all your help. We beat the bullies. Thank you. Heidi

I contacted Sam earlier this year, having been put in a difficult position by my employer.
I’d tried to initially deal with the situation myself, but my employer tried to ride rough shod over me. I contacted Sam to discuss / write my grievance appeal and it was the best decision I made. He was open and honest, very knowledgeable and from the initial phone call, I knew that I could trust him to assist. He explained everything in detail, put together a structure, and quickly gave me the confidence to fight my case. Sam was there every step of the way. He always stuck to deadlines and correspondence produced was consistently to a high standard. Sam was reassuring whilst always being brutally honest and realistic. The past 6 months have been extremely stressful, but a settlement has now been reached, thanks to Sam’s help and involvement. I’d have no hesitation at all in recommending Sam should you find yourself in the unfortunate position of needing help in this specialist area. Yours – Mike and Maureen

I used Sam’s services initially to write my first grievance letter and he has assisted me with responding to every letter from my employer since.  It has been quite a journey and I could not have done any of it without Sam’s patience, knowledge and hard work to scrutinise every letter my employer sent. I have been on sick leave for a year and with Sam’s help have received full pay during my time off.  I am still awaiting resolution with my employer, however, armed with the six grievance letters Sam has put together, I am confident my employer will agree a settlement figure that I will be content with. If you are reading this testimonial, considering whether or not to use Sam’s services, do not hesitate because you honestly won’t regret it. THANK YOU Sam for EVERYTHING. Louise

Two and a half months ago I was in a really bad place. I was being bullied and victimised at work and was facing a disciplinary investigation which was worded to imply gross misconduct and safeguarding concerns (extremely serious given the nature of my work). I was also in a capability process for not being able to do three people’s jobs.
My union representative, whilst supportive, said I should accept the disciplinary process. Had I done this I would never have been able to work in my profession again. I stumbled across Sam’s website purely by chance. The best decision I ever made was picking up the phone to call Sam. He worked tirelessly for me and nearly three months later I am in receipt of a settlement agreement which includes a good reference and a healthy financial package to give me a cushion whilst I look for another job. Sam tied the investigating officer in absolute eloquent knots with his limitless knowledge of the law. There is nothing he does not know and is far better able to help than a solicitor. He also acts as a counsellor as he really, really cares and completely understands what you are going through. He is always available for you, you are not alone. It is very isolating being the victim of bullying and discrimination at work, more so for me as being a single parent I have sole responsibility for supporting my child. Sam has restored my self confidence and made me realise it was not normal to work in those conditions. I dread to think how things would have ended up had I not had Sam on my side. If you have found this website it means you are suffering at work. Please don’t suffer any longer – give Sam a call. Sam, thank you for everything, you’re a complete star xx (Client wishes to remain anonymous).

Dearest Sam & Amy, where do I start! I’d dedicated most of my working life to the public sector, successful and happy. My partner and I worked for the same employer. Following a change of structure and management my partner and I found ourselves on the end of a bullying and harassment campaign led by a prominent senior manager. The toxic campaign would span out over 4+ years. I found myself unfairly placed on a PIP and my partner accused of wrongdoing. The continuation of bullying and harassment finally came to head where my partner and I felt there was little alternative but to take sick leave for the first time in my career. Sick with worry, stress and anxiety, I was in a very dark place in my life, knowing that a grievance would rock the boat, I knew I needed to get this right, but how? I had no experience of writing such things. I couldn’t even think straight.  I took to the internet to research how to write a grievance and by God’s grace I came across Sam & Amy.
When I read the information and watched the video, I really felt like this guy knew what I was talking about, felt my pain, and knew a way how to fix it. I took a leap of faith and telephoned Sam; my worries, strain and strife were somewhat alleviated from that first telephone call and I felt like I could breathe again. From my first conversation Sam’s interpretation of what had happened was staggering, he articulated it with a legal spin from the offset, it was mind blowing.
From the mountains of information I sent to them, Sam & Amy produced a grievance and dozens of supporting exhibits which was an unbelievable piece of work. I submitted the grievance to the chief executive and never looked back!  The thought of attending OH and managing attendance meetings was causing the highest levels of stress and anxiety, again Sam & Amy were the calming influence and wrote many weighty letters. I didn’t once have to go back to into work nor see my employers again. This guy is a machine! More than this, Sam & Amy care. From start to finish the whole debacle lasted nearly a year. They were always there whenever we felt in a state of panic or when the bullying letters came through the post from the employer. Sam’s calming voice, funny sense of humour and plan of action helped us stay composed and gave us the ability to function.
Even whilst they were on holiday Sam & Amy stopped at the side of a road to give us assistance. No where else will you get this commitment or care. I reached a settlement agreement before ET proceedings started, which was a much higher settlement figure than what I ever imagined. I’m under no illusion that I find myself in this now fortunate position because of Sam & Amy. I’ll always feel indebted to them for getting us out of a dark period and where we are now. Truly kind people, who help people fight wrongs – you’ll won’t come across many people in life so selfless and for the greater good. Keep fighting the wrongs guys, the world is better place with you in it. Thank you will never be enough to express our gratitude. With much love to you all, Robert.

When the misuse of Whistleblowing policy by senior management brought false accusations against me, I was placed on a PIP, and left with little choice but to go on sick leave. I was at one of the lowest points in my life, anxious and stressed and suffering panic attacks – it was a devastating time which I couldn’t see an end of.  Having no experience in grievance writing or the legalities of policies or HR behaviours I didn’t know where to start so I frantically searched the internet for help. By some unbelievable luck I stumbled upon Sam & Amy’s website. I read through testimonials and the mountains of information on there and plucked up the courage to contact Sam. It’ll probably be one of the best decisions I’ve made or will ever make. My grievances consisted of two strands, the whistleblowing allegations alongside the bullying and harassment. To the naked eye it appeared complex and near impossible to interpret.  After the first phone call to Sam, I immediately felt some of the stress and worry ease. Sam’s immediate interpretation of the whole intertwined cases was somewhat superhuman! From that point onwards I didn’t once feel alone. I sent Sam & Amy mountains of information from which they wrote two comprehensive grievance letters.
From SAR requests to disability discrimination there is no point of employment law, that Sam & Amy don’t know. Sam explained that the grievance procedures are not legal procedures. However, the level of care, attention and standard we experienced with Sam and Amy was way, way above anything you’d find at a solicitors, it was pretty special. Your fight is their fight; they really care and understand. Sam & Amy are two of the most unselfish, caring adept people you’ll meet. Their support is unwavering. My case reached a settlement through ACAS once the grievance and disciplinary procedures had been exhausted resulting in a substantial pay out and compensation. But more than the compensation payments, I now have peace and happiness and can put the dark period behind me. I am under no illusion that it’s all Sam & Amy’s letters which accomplished the employer settling. It would have been impossible to get through these dark times without them. All the best Susan.

Hi Sam,
I can’t quite put into words how thankful I am for your website and templates for all the help and support it gave me whilst going through a grievance at work last year.
I was treated like utter crap in the first instance through bullying & work pressure, and once I started the grievance procedure it became much worse, just like you said, it wasn’t an easy task and it took approx 10 months to resolve in the end.
I worked for a large law firm (as an accountant) and they thought they could bully me further into giving up the grievance & quietly going away. They tried every trick in the book, just as you said they would- missing sick notes, doctored documentation, dragging processes out etc. I got to the point where I was dealing with the Partner/Head of the employment law department and it was taking its toll on my health further with the stress, but there was no way I was giving up & allowing anyone to treat me like that, and your website helped me to stay focused on the task in hand.
By using your templates, and studying your website daily I went through the whole grievance procedure and caused them as much trouble as they caused me.  I thought my first grievance letter was a work of art but my appeal grievance really did pack some punches! I’m so proud of it I could frame it! I really did put them in their place & I felt that I beat them at their own game – law!
I took them to 2 preliminary tribunal hearings whereby they went in my favour and the company finally settled before continuing on to further hearings.
The settlement agreement that they produced was the longest that my solicitors had ever seen, and this made me laugh so much, I had obviously rattled them and they weren’t leaving anything to chance.
The settlement figure pretty much covered my solicitors fees so financially I didn’t really gain but the very fact that I put up a bloody good fight, and one in which I feel I won, is absolutely priceless to me. All I wanted was to firstly show that I was not tolerating being treated like that & secondly, I didn’t want to be to be financially worse off and I’m happy I achieved both those things.
They did not want to pay me a penny so the fact they paid £5.5k and had to pay independent solicitors to attend the hearings satisfies me greatly!
I could not have done this without your website & templates, and I feel it’s important you know just how much support and confidence this gives people. There is nothing else like it on the web and even though my solicitors were helpful during the end of my case, you were far more knowledegable, experienced and sympathetic because you know what being in this situation is like.
I am now trying to support my friend from the same workplace, who is now off with work related stress and again I am looking on your website. She doesn’t want to go down the grievance procedure so I’m going to look into whistleblowing and see if that’s relevant. It angers me that they clearly haven’t learnt their lessons and are causing people ill health through their lack of care!
But for now, I’d like to say a huge thank you!!! I can’t explain fully how helpful and supportive your services have been for me so I hope you know that all your hard work with the website is doing what you intended & helping people like me beat the bullying firms.
THANK YOU 🙏🏻 😊
Kind Regards, Jenny.

“He’s in your corner, watching your back” –
I was going through a very dark period in my life, having suffered a mental breakdown due to issues caused in the workplace.  Initially, I raised my grievance informally with HR, but as this proved ineffective, I felt I had no alternative other than to seek legal advice.  I spoke with several solicitors, all of whom advised me to write a formal grievance letter to my employer. Having never raised a grievance before this episode, I deliberated on how to write a grievance letter that would be taken seriously by my employer/HR.  Accordingly, I did what most people would do, I searched Google and came across Sam Stone/Formal Grievance. What a find; what a godsend! Sam was absolutely brilliant and fought my corner.  He gave me the confidence to stand up to my employer and effectively say “NO” and push back. His exceptional knowledge of the law and quoting the law in writing, enabled me to be one step ahead of HR by challenging any action they proposed which would be to my detriment.  Sam’s understanding and experience of how HR departments handle workplace grievances enabled him to be able to think ahead and outsmart HR by anticipating what they would do next and then tying them into knots, whereby they were unable to do anything without compromising themselves or looking ineffective!
Sam was always there for me, including the weekends, with conference calls; on the spot exchanging web links to previous case law; quoting the law, and exchange of draft letters via a secure email server. Without Sam, I would have been “shown the door” very quickly by my employer.  However, with Sam, I was able to continue working and leave my employer on a negotiated settlement agreement.  He gave me the confidence to hold my head high and effectively leave on my terms; not my employers. Without hesitation I would highly recommend Sam; he knows the law, watches your back and is there for you.  He’s been there too, he’s one of us, and as such fully understands what you are going through.

Sam was incredibly helpful and I completely recommend him to anyone facing the complexity and intensity of a grievance with their employer or any employment matter. I was really unsure and anxious with the whole grievance process and my employer was not making it easy for me at all. Initially I have to say, that I was rather skeptical about using Sam. His letters were very strong and made me panic slightly, however I quickly understood the need for the strength within these letters and as soon as we received help from Sam it was like a breath of fresh air and I must say without his help I do not think that we would have achieved such a good settlement with my employer. Sam was there for me through the whole process, he is not just knowledgeable about the legislation but he cares deeply about employee rights.  Sam doesn’t just point you to the relevant legislation but guides you through everything. He responds promptly to questions and queries and is always there to offer assistance and support.  His attitude is completely professional his knowledge and understanding of employment legislation is magnificent, his letters and emails were far superior to our solicitor’s letters, explaining legislation and understanding our case far better than our solicitor. I am in no doubt that his support and help in writing to my employers was a key factor in convincing my employer of the many mistakes they had committed and was strategic in making them settle without the need for ACAS and an employment tribunal. One thing I must say to everyone in this predicament, is that you have to be strong within the grievance process and understand that as soon as you make a grievance, your employer is not your friend. Having a friend like Sam will help you through the process and help to take so much of the stress out of things, but at the same time without being forceful with you. Sam will guide and direct you in the right direction. His experience in this area is boundless! Thank you so much Sam for your help and support you were our savior.
God bless you! Anonymous

I was recommended to contact Sam at
www.formalgrivance.com
by a friend who had previously had problems at work and told me how Sam had assisted her through the grievance processes successfully and got her job back. So I contacted Sam and from the outset he was great. It felt like he truly understood the horror of my situation and genuinely wanted to help me, which he did. The care and attention to detail he took in writing the formal grievance letter allowed me the confidence of a lawyer without the expense! My employers were soon keen to settle out of court and we did so relatively swiftly without the need for a meeting. There were several times before this point that I rang Sam in tears, angry and frustrated and he was able to help me see clearly again and give me much needed hope and confidence. When something like this happens it rocks your world. Sam helps you put it back together. I would highly recommend him to anyone who might be having problems with employers or at work. With huge thanks again.
Kindest regards – Heather

I am not even sure where to start when it comes to this man! What a God send. I was completely lost before I came across his website. I was in desperate need of employment assistance. I had been to see a few solicitors who were useless and just wanted my money. After spending hours online I found this website. I contacted Sam even though I was a little skeptical at first but as soon as we spoke I felt at ease. He is extremely knowledgable when it comes to employment law and he explains everything clearly. I honestly feel blessed to have come across this man because through his guidance and help writing my appeal letter I was able to come to a settlement out of court quite quickly. Sam thank you so much. What had been a really difficult period in my life you have turned around into a win for me!

Dear Sam
I cannot thank you enough for helping, supporting and giving me hope at my lowest point in my life, my only regret is I didn’t stumble upon you sooner as I have no doubt it wouldn’t have dragged on as long as it has. As a HR manager for a large company with over 11 years service I found myself being bullied and victimised by my new line manager. Whilst I followed company procedure and wrote a grievance against my line manager, the company did not do anything to resolve the situation and I found myself on the outside and very alone. I may never get over what has happened but Sam made me stronger and helped me write my grievance appeal letter that tore the grievance outcome letter to shreds and tied them up in knots. The appeal letter has given me options and left the company with very few, as Sam has very cleverly incorporated relevant case law into my appeal letter. Sam may not have a law degree but what he doesn’t know about the law, isn’t worth knowing. I spoke to several solicitors along my way and none of them were passionate about my case. I couldn’t afford solicitor prices as I had been on SSP for the past 6 months but knew I needed real help and then Sam appears on my screen and we arranged a telephone consultation for the next day, which was a Sunday.  After our conversation I didn’t feel alone anymore and it gave me the strength to carry on fighting them. Sam worked relentlessly putting together my appeal letter (all 52 pages) and always responded very quickly to texts, emails or calls. Sam was also there for me when I was having doubts and feeling low reassuring me that they would be the ones feeling low when they receive the appeal letter. I seriously can’t recommend Sam highly enough, he is a genius and genuinely cares. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks Sam – Katy

Sam, what can I say… a million thank you’s wouldn’t be enough, I will be forever grateful for everything you did for me. After going through what can only be described as the worst time of my life, suffering from severe stress, anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and even a visit to hospital in the ambulance all caused by work and the pressure they put me under that built up over a number of years, I was signed off sick.
I spoke to numerous solicitors and lawyers, who were all unhelpful and wanted thousands and thousands of pounds just to look into my issues, I didn’t know what to do or where to turn for help, After numerous sleepless nights, I was sat  browsing the internet seeing what I could do next, and I ended up finding your website, after reading every page numerous times and all the testimonials, I decided to give you a call, this without a doubt was the best decision I have ever made, from day one you were more than helpful, totally supportive and gave me guidance better than any lawyer could, your knowledge of employment law is unquestionable and really impressive, and all done in a way in which someone who doesn’t understand employment law can understand.
You helped me write a grievance letter using your template which must have given my HR department nightmares, after numerous letters back and forth, and further grievances and whistle blowing, all which you helped write, my employer offered a settlement, which was higher than either of us expected, I rejected this and they offered even more which I accepted.
You were always available to give support, and even just speaking to you made me feel much better, I really don’t know how I would have gotten through this without your help, guidance and support, you always responded really quickly to my questions. I can’t recommend you highly enough. To anyone reading this, who is in the same place I was, don’t hesitate to give Sam a call. Sam once again thank you for everything from the bottom of my heart, you really are amazing, you have got me to a position where I can move forward with my life with positivity and with a lot less stress.

When my wife found Sam’s website it was a lifeline.  I had been to hell and back over a substantial time period and each time the damage to my health was greater and was leaving me feeling destitute, desperate and my mental health was severely affected.  I had seen others go through similar, only to lose their career and livelihood. I felt my fate had been sealed, by being of older years and in a trade union, which didn’t bode well.
I was relied upon by my family to put the basics of a roof over their head and all that goes with my role as a husband and father, but my company saw this as a weakness and they chose to exploit this by creating a culture of fear in those within the same age bracket and who subscribed to being in a union.
My job wasn’t one of a high caliber or wage, however it was one that I had a talent for and enjoyed, had dedicated decades to and had tremendous pride in carrying out.  I had envisioned working in this role until retirement.  The company had other ideas.  Older workers, disabled or those who were in a union were seen in a negative light and every opportunity was utilized to force them from their employ. No mercy, no mitigating circumstances.  Chosen to be “black balled” for not being young or dynamic enough to represent the younger facing representatives they wanted to be the face of the future within the company.
Then Sam entered our life, initially he couldn’t take us due to his full diary and customers already on his books, so my wife followed his advice and scrutinized his site for all of the basic information she could to make the most of what was available at that time. This decision would change our lives.
Once the letter of grievance template was used, the company sat up and took notice. The grievance as per Sam’s site advised was not upheld in my favour.  I purchased the Grievance Appeal template and this was yet another nail in the company’s coffin.  Now they knew they were in for a fight.
Needless to say Sam was again right, the company trounced the Appeal, as with the Grievance.  Falling dismally by negating to address the issues raised in both and knowing that redress through the grievance policy exhausted they went on the attack. Mistake, big mistake.
Sam now had a vacancy on his books and we handed him the reigns and from then on, he took center stage and wiped the floor with the HR Dept, Management and Legal Department.  Sam never wavered, he dealt them blow for blow, not letting them recover from each blooded nose.  Sam pulled no punches, he knew the laws they had breached, the Acts they had shown no regard for in Employment Law and led them by the nose ring on each occasion, never once letting them get the upper hand.
I am back at work now, which wasn’t foreseen and in a differing role, away from the dept that had made me so very ill.
If I can describe this kind, funny, knowledgeable man as a saint then to us he is just that.  The one thing Sam is the greatest tool you can have in your arsenal when it comes to being on your side, by your side and in your corner Sam Stone is “The Man” someone we are proud to call a friend and confidant.
Others in my company are coming forward, approaching me to ask for help and the only help they need is to call/contact Sam.
The hours he works, to the “Nth degree” and for a fee that is affordable even in the face of adversity, “our man Sam” made that possible.   Thanks to Sam and Amy for being there for people like us.
You know who we are Sam, a family whom will always be in your debt.
Should anyone doubt our word and wish to confirm all that is said is as stated above, then we will be more than happy to do so via our friend Sam’s discretion, we give permission for Sam to pass on any communication to us, which we will respond as affirmation of the above testimony.

If you are reading the Testimony Page on Sam Stones website then I guess you must be feeling like I did, over 6 months ago. I came upon Sam’s Website after googling “how to write an appeal letter” due to going through some tough times at work. I was bullied, lied about, intimidated, harassed, and discriminated against. I was not being listened too when I took my complaints to HR. This is damaging to anyone. Being treated unfairly at work changes your outlook on life and in humans. It damages yourself worth and confidence.
Well if you are feeling all or any of that then do not hesitate in contacting Sam and his wife Amy. I am a Christian and I prayed for a Divine Intervention to help me with the challenging time at work…and GOD sent me “angels Sam & Amy.” Sam is a dedicated guy with a wonderful wife by the side of him who have heaps and mounds of knowledge that has blown my mind. When he prepared the letters for me for my HR department I felt listened to, protected, a light on a very dark path and HOPE that I was going to get through all of this mess and horrid-ness. Sam is very professional with a sense of humour who completely has your back. The charge that Sam asks for is a minuscule amount really compared to having other legal sources working on your behalf. Please do not hesitate in contacting Sam…as I believe that if you are looking on his site you must feel you need help. You have nothing to lose but so much to gain. Your selfworth ~ your confidence ~ your identity ~ your self-esteem, your dignity, restored faith in human kind and clearing your name. Sam is the man you need. You will be richly blessed in having him in your life and before you know it you will writing a testimony of your own to tell others how much he has helped to change your life and regain it back for you.

Sam’s expertise were recommended to me at a point where I felt I had no where else to go and no one to turn too with regards to my work situation. I felt I was fighting an uphill battle with work and I was exhausted; I was very close to giving up on the grievance process and leaving. I scanned the website, paying particular attention to the testimonials and I wasn’t disappointed. So, I reached out to Sam and we had an initial consultation within 24hrs and we discussed if / how to progress; I was lucky that Sam had the time to help me with my case. In that moment, I realised I wasn’t going completely insane and that I was doing the right thing by raising these problems with my employer. I felt a great sense of relief. To put this in to context, the call was when I was already off sick with work related ‘challenges’ that had escalated over the last year. It got so bad I decided to raise a grievance and tackle it head on. I’d had no reply from my employer on my grievance, the investigation was a shambles and there was no sign of any outcome. After 6 turbulent months from grievance kick-off and 2 years in to this situation I was drained mentally, emotionally and physically. Despite chasing, hoping for an email one day that things would change, it didn’t and it aggravated my work related stressors. From the consultation call, Sam guided me through next steps and within a week I had a written letter I could send to my employer. Within 2 weeks I had a large detailed document which I could send to my employer which was worth every penny. It instantly got the attention of the right department and people. It’s down to Sam’s help and guidance that I have now agreed a settlement and an outcome that I am very happy with; I am forever in Sam’s debt. God bless. Thanks Sam! :)~

I have enlisted Sam Stone’s support on two separate occasions whereby my managers’ unscrupulous treatment of service users were the sole reasons I did my best to follow my employers’ internal whistle blowing procedures in good faith. In both cases, I did this to my own cost in that I was sacked for having blown the whistle both times. In the end, and in both cases, Sam got me through and my employers ultimately backed down. I don’t regret maintaining my professional standards. My career flourishes at the time of writing this I am happy to tell you. As a highly trained professional I would blow the whistle again in a heartbeat for the people I support. Sam Stone is the bravery that every such fighter needs for the battle. I daresay more would be emboldened were they to encounter Sam. The first time I stood my ground, I managed to find Sam via the internet. He gave me courage when I felt truly broken, disillusioned, and betrayed. I had tried to help. I couldn’t believe I would be professionally attacked for doing so. When this happened the second time, I questioned myself but was able to understand – with Sam’s insights – that sadly this is far too often how systems work. Sam went the extra mile to help me make sense as to why my employers were on the defensive and to realise this is not so unusual. Sam managed to normalise that for me such that I stopped blaming myself. He made time for me. He listened respectfully and lessened the gravity of the situation with his brilliant humour. In both cases, I felt scared and it was not easy to believe I would be ok, but his letters and his knowledge of case law together with his characteristic ‘warrior’ stance gave me strength. The reactions of my employers in both cases was worth more to me than the not so unreasonable price I paid to protect myself – my career – from such underhandedness. Standing up for the rights of vulnerable people is not for the faint hearted. As a health professional, I am duty bound to ensure that safe, humane and ethical practices are a matter of routine rather than a breathe of fresh air. Like most of you, I must continue to work for a living. Just because unscrupulous and unethical employers are out there doesn’t mean you can’t remain in a profession you value. You might gather by all that I have written that I cannot recommend Sam Stone highly enough. Thank you, Sam.

I cannot thank Sam Stone enough for all his hard work that he did for me when I was unfairly dismissed from my job because of a fall that I had in which I broke my arm. I was working in this job for 17 years. Sam was always there for me through thick and thin and although I never met Sam in person he was like a friend who I could call and ask for help and felt relaxed talking with him. All I can say is a big THANK YOU SAM from the bottom of my heart for putting up with all my emails, phone calls and loads of questions and most of all for getting back my job that I was dismissed from 2 months ago! Well done!! I would definitely recommend you to anyone who is in my position.

Dear Sam, I like you thank you so much for helping me throughout my grievance process effectively, steadfastly and in a timely manner throughout and to its conclusion. I could have not fought my corner without your support; your compassionate and caring approach; sharp mind for relevant details and your in depth experience and knowledge of legal matters.  You had along the way empowered me with your abilities to stay focused. You were instrumental in helping me obtain a very good settlement from my employer off the back of many relevant and thoughtful letters that you wrote for my grievances. I would not hesitate to emphasise the fact that if I had not sought your help, I don’t believe my employer would have settled. My family and I are forever indebted to you. You are a force for good in this world.  I hope you can see how you affect people’s life for good and empower them against big guys. All the best to you and your family.

I reported my line manager for bullying and harassment to three senior managers, as far back as 2013, but my complaints were basically ignored. Finally I went through a grievance procedure using Sam’s grievance letter template. This helped me write a very detailed grievance statement, but again my complaints were ignored. Over the years my health has suffered, sleepless nights, the tears, snapping at loved ones, my body physically responding to stress. I had worked with the company since 1983 no one person has a right to make a dedicated staff member feel like this. By the appeal stage I felt that I had no chance of getting any fair play. My husband and I studied and read everything written on Sam’s Web Site and without anything to loose we rang him.
All I can say is THANK GOODNESS I did.
We had a good chat and explained my problems and Sam had heard all this before and said we needed to take control. On explaining what he could do to help us we did not hesitate and very quickly Sam had letters written for me to send my bosses about their discriminatory behaviour. Sam responded to any communication we sent him nearly straight away. He took away the burden of writing the letters to my employers which I felt was a great weight off my shoulders. He was very kind and on occasion very funny but always understanding and sympathetic to my problems. Sam’s knowledge on the employment law is amazing and although things are still ongoing at present my husband and I feel very optimistic about the outcome since we had Sam on our side. My husband and I feel that saying thank you is not a strong enough expression for how we feel about what you’ve done to help us but dear friends Sam and Amy thank you and bless you both.

Working in the financial industry in the City as a woman is tough at the best of times but raising a grievance against a financial goliath you may find yourself where I was 4 months ago. I thought that I could handle the situation myself and chose not to take legal advice, as the solicitors I had approached only wanted to steer me down the constructive dismissal route without fully understanding my grievance.
My grievance was multi layered and complex spread over a prolonged period to include bullying and harassment, disability discrimination and whistleblowing. My health was negatively impacted and I wanted to depart my company swiftly, but with dignity and after being heard. However, my grievance was written from an emotional perspective and I failed to highlight the points of law and where my company had legally failed. I may have had a strong case but without the ability to articulate this, in legal terms, and take some control back from my company, I was set to lose my appeal. It couldn’t have got any worse at that stage.
I honestly thought at one point, after I received the initial grievance hearing outcome which was a complete whitewash, that my grievance was to be completely ignored, multiple breaches of the law pushed aside and that my company was simply playing lip service to the process. I was incredibly frustrated that I was failing to clearly articulate my claims and importantly that I was not going to be heard. I was scared at this point. 20 years in the Square Mile with an impeccable career history and I potentially couldn’t even guarantee I would come out of this with a good reference, let alone winning my case.  I needed a divine intervention….Then found Sam Stone!
I had been researching employment law when I fell upon one of Sam’s grievance letter templates which led me to his site. I read his web pages and then the testimonials. Was this guy for real? Could Sam be my savior? Should I trust and put my hope in a complete stranger on the internet? I felt had two choices Fight or Flight, to walk away to ensure a good reference or approach Sam for help. I didn’t have much left to lose as I felt completely isolated, overwhelmed and alone.  My trade union was a complete waste of time.
I trusted my instinct and contacted Sam. I just wanted to understand why was I not being heard and how I could take back the control and make my company take accountability for their conduct and behaviour. To say I was skeptical was an understatement. I am a very cautious person and as Judge Judy would say, ‘if it seems too good to be true, it probably is’. However I had nothing to lose at that point so I made the call. This turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. After a 30-minute telephone conversation with Sam I released this was the person to help me. His knowledge of employment law is truly exceptional. He is a human encyclopedia of employment law and I was very impressed, not only due to his knowledge of the law but his ability to quickly understand my case, cut through the crap and identify why I was struggling to articulate my situation, and explain what needed to be done to get my grievance back on track.
I provided Sam with a folder of 1000s of pages of information. Sam did not simply flick through the information but studied this over a period of days and his attention to detail was amazing. As my case was so complex, Sam wrote a 70+ page appeal document. Upon receiving and reading this document I initially winced as it was brutal! After reading it several times more I started to laugh out loud. It was the first smile I had had in months. The document was a work of art! I kept thinking of the saying ‘are you still beating you wife’!  This is how Sam had drafted my appeal. He had left no stone unturned and focused only on the points of the law, where my employer had failed legally, why they had failed and positioned it so that they had no choice but to respond to each point. Essentially Sam managed to shift the control in my favour so that my company now had the responsibility for the burden of truth.
My employer had been stringing the process along for months, but after sending the appeal document to them the negotiation process quickly commenced. Now my employer was listening! They did not even wish to hear the appeal after reading the document. They were completely blindsided. Sam made my employer look inept, incompetent and unprofessional. I successfully negotiated an exit and a settlement. Sam is aware of every angle and trick that employers try to use against you. He is not intimidated by threats and his knowledge of employment law is second to none. He is a true professional.
If you are reading my advice is to give Sam Stone a call. Speak to him and make up your own mind. It may be the best decision you may ever make.
God bless Sam Stone (and Amy!)

If you are reading this you may be doing exactly what I was doing almost a year ago.
I was being bullied and harassed by my employer for being off work through illness.
In September 2017 I returned to work after being absent with irritable bowel and arthritis. Upon my return to work my boss had moved me to a different role. He knew that I would not be able to carry out the duties this role involved. This was a deliberate act.
I then suffered a workplace injury while carrying out this new role.
I was injured, but as I was yet again off sick, panic, anxiety and depression set in. I thought very seriously about resigning from the job I had for 15 years.
I was beaten.
My boss had won.
He had managed to manipulate circumstances and made decisions that had a huge impact on my life.
My trade union was a complete waste of time.
I called 2 employment law solicitors who informed me there was nothing they could do for me. I was now rock bottom.
My husband then read some of the testimonials on Sam’s web site.
He said we could give him a call to see if he could offer any help. I was totally and utterly against this. Why on earth would I trust some random person on the internet, when employment solicitors and a well renowned trade union had told me we did not have a case.
To say I was sceptical would be an understatement, by nature I am a very cautious person who does not trust people easily. You hear of so many internet scams where people have been duped.
After several days of my husbands nagging, and many more sleepless nights, I relented, and a call was made to Sam.
This turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life.
After a 30-minute telephone conversation with Sam my whole world changed.
He understood I how felt, he knew what I was going through. What he did was to give me hope.
Within a couple of weeks he had drafted a formal grievance letter that was over 20 pages long. This was nothing short of magnificent!
Not only did the letter explain how my employer had carried discriminatory acts against me, he proved how they had done this by citing employment law and cases from the employment tribunals.
When my employer received this letter they were so shocked they did not know how to react.
They then went on further discriminate against me. Sam drafted another formal grievance letter citing case law and further discrimination.
Every single tactic they tried to use against me Sam had an employment law ace up his sleeve, he tied them up in knots.
Sam is not a solicitor, but knows every angle that employers try to use against you. He is not intimidated by employers veiled threats. I was astonished by his level of competence, knowledge and sheer professionalism.
He made my employers look inept and unprofessional in their understanding of employment law.
Any communication with him was answered within 24 hours maximum, very often he would contact me within a couple of hours either by phone or email.
Having Sam in my corner gave me back hope and belief that I could get justice against my bullying employer.
It was like having Superman, Batman and Robin, Spiderman, Robin Hood Captain America and Jack Reacher all working for me!!
Joseph Roux was quoted as saying, “When unhappy, one doubts everything; when happy one doubts nothing.”
If you cast your doubts about using Sam to one side you will have nothing to fear.
He is honest and straightforward, he does not give you a sales pitch, he does not give you false hope, he deals in facts and the law. I cannot recommend the services of Sam highly enough.
My advice to anyone who is having employment problems is: Give Sam Stone a call.
Thank you Sam.

I originally contacted Sam in 2015 when I was having a horrendous time with my employer. I was having sleepless nights, tears, and was signed off sick by my GP. Sam wrote a grievance letter which was very articulate, and had points of law I didn’t even know existed. The employer only listened to half of it and didn’t invoke all the reasonable adjustments I had asked for. Then in 2017 I was up against unsatisfactory performance, which came as a complete shock. With Sam’s help we put in another grievance letter in 2017, which was so well written that I wanted to frame it! Again, they ignored it, they kept passing it off to other people. I would not have got this far without Sam. The employer seemed hell bent in hitting me with their policy sticks that they didn’t stick to their own policies themselves! (Grievance) HR what a joke, they didn’t help, they drove it. The Union were useless. They didn’t want to help either. It has been an horrendous year, but I have to say I am so grateful to Sam for his help, even working on the grievance whilst he was on his leave, constant phone calls from myself whilst I was feeling low and needed some light at the end of the tunnel.

I am a senior manager who had been working for my employer for over 7 years at the time, during which time my contribution helped the business achieve significant year on year double digit growth.
I had joined the business shortly after graduating and therefore I miss-understood the regular bullying, harassment, racial discrimination, physical assault and victimisation as “normal”, and often put it down to my inexperience. However, over time this started to affect my confidence level’s; personally and professionally.
However, it wasn’t until I started to suffer from anxiety, sleep and panic disorders that I began to realise there was a problem. After consulting with some close friends and family, and for the first time opening up about these issues at work, I finally realised this wasn’t normal and instead injustice. I felt I had left it too late and my mental health suffered significantly as a result. I felt depressed and after visiting the doctor, I was signed-off with mental health sickness.
This was the point at which I decided to seek professional help, and through some research, a friend had done on my behalf, he recommended me to Sam. This was the turning point of my life and professional career.
Since speaking to Sam about the situation, he was sympathetic, understanding, provided moral support, and consulted professionally on employment law, and helped me identify the many unjust examples where the company had failed to comply in accordance to the ACAS code. He has always been available to speak with whenever I have needed him. Furthermore, Sam also took away the burden of writing up the grievance, appeal, and every email communication in response to my employer regarding the situation. He also provided impartial and honest support with every step of the way through the process.
If you are in a similar situation, and debating whether to use Sam’s professional services or a registered lawyer/solicitor – I would recommend Sam every single time. In my experience legal firms are only in it for the money, whereas Sam is personally invested in helping resolve the matter and making sure your side of the story is fully heard. He takes a zero-tolerance approach to employers who think they can get away with it!
Thank you, Sam. The help, support and guidance you have given me has been invaluable!

I raised a grievance at work and frankly it was going nowhere. The company was flouting all the procedures and didn’t want to settle.  I phoned several employment solicitors who were apathetic and not scary enough so I searched for alternatives.  I came across Sam’s website and after some deliberation gave him a phone.  What a turn-around! He took my initial grievance and created a document which had my company flouting every employment law known to man.  A work of art I have to say!  There were 35 pages of legalese that would have any organisation running for the hills.  Within 2 days my company wanted to settle for a very generous sum.  My only regret is that I didn’t find Sam in time to write the original grievance! Please do yourself a favour and get Sam to write your grievance and save yourself a lot of grief!

I can’t express how grateful I am to Sam and Amy, who have saved my career and my sanity when I had lost hope and broken down  My case has gone on for over two years and throughout that time, Sam has been available to me on the phone and writing documents which have slowly but surely turned the tables on my employer. I work for a large public sector organisation, with a hierarchical male dominated management structure and managers, HR staff and in house employment lawyers who are devious and bullying.
Approximately two years ago, my new manager and the manager above commenced a disciplinary investigation against me – totally unfounded and discriminatory in nature.  I endured a disciplinary investigation lasting over 6 months, in an atmosphere of fear where colleagues were lying about me to ingratiate themselves with management.  I was in a state of breakdown, bursting into tears in the office, unable to sleep, unable to watch tv or read a book, my every waking thought was dominated by thoughts of the work situation, it was all I could talk about with family and friends.  I was paralysed by indecision and couldn’t think things through.  I became paranoid and fearful that people were turning against me and felt that I couldn’t bear to have anybody walking or standing behind me anywhere, out in the street or in a café. I felt anxious, depressed and fearful.
I had endured other trauma in my personal life, and now this was too much to bear – I felt they were hellbent on driving me out of the organisation, or forcing me to have a breakdown and I also felt that they would never give up.  They were relentless and aggressive.
I was also a member of a trade union but when I turned to the union for help and trusted them, the rep betrayed that trust and tried to make out it was all in my head and that I was a difficult person.  I later found out that she was working with management and HR in their best interests rather than mine. When I saw a Union solicitor they were hopeless and didn’t seem to get it, saying my case didn’t have reasonable prospect of success.
There was no way I could afford a solicitor, so I read a lot on the internet including Sam’s templates which were brilliant, and then put in a formal grievance and hoped that it would be enough.
Unfortunately, my grievance was not upheld and in fact the grievance investigation and report that was produced seemed to be a further way for management to bully and discriminate against me.  I had hoped that they would see sense and stop their action, but they didn’t.
I needed help, support and expertise in this field, I couldn’t handle it on my own anymore, I was at a very low ebb and didn’t know what I was going to do.  I could see my career disappearing away.  Even though I was nervous about paying a stranger on the internet to help me, and about sending information, I had my first telecon with Sam and Amy.
From that moment on, I felt so relieved – Sam outlined what I needed to do and how we needed to take back power and control.  I’ll never forget him saying that his letter would have the effect of getting the managers up against the wall and giving them several good hard punches to the stomach!  That sounded brilliant to me and it made me laugh at a very dark moment.  The thought of that still makes me laugh two years later.  The letter was great and it got things onto a far more equal footing with my employer.  Getting Sam and Amy involved meant that a huge weight lifted from my shoulders – I no longer had to deal with this on my own.  I had two people here who had been down this same road and triumphed and who cared and wanted to help me.
Sam and Amy continued to help me throughout that year, always available on the phone to keep me going and writing letters to counter what the managers did next.  Further down the line, Sam wrote an amazing grievance appeal document, running to around 100 pages! Another phone call with Sam stands out in my mind, where he said to me “Sooner or later, one side will crack, and it won’t be you!”  In the dark days when I could see no end in sight, I kept thinking that to myself and believing it.
When I faced attending multiple occupational health referrals, Sam helped me again, with strategy and support.  Due to him, I went to these meetings feeling confident and able to openly record the meetings on a small voice recorder, and request sight of the reports for my approval, before they went to my employer.
None of my grievances were upheld – as the managers were brazen and entrenched in their bullying and discriminatory ways.
However, the letters that Sam wrote gave me the strength to take the matter to the employment tribunal, which I did without any legal assistance.  I launched tribunal action with around 30 charges, against my employer.  I always had the thought that I would start it and see where it got to – I did not feel comfortable, but I almost felt I had no choice – it was a protective move – to try and stop the managers once and for all, with the power of external scrutiny via the tribunal.
So, now, some two years since it all started, I have finally been offered and taken a settlement agreement from my employer and will continue in my work hopefully without any further discrimination from the managers.  They tried to get rid of me, but failed, thanks to Sam and Amy!
I am sure that the only reason I finally got the managers to back off is because of Sam and Amy helping me.  Without the letters that they wrote, I would not have been able to play the correct moves in the game, and without their positivity and kindness, I would not have been able to mentally continue fighting for so long.
I count myself so lucky that I was able to have Sam’s help.  He is extremely good at what he does and a very kind guy as well.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Sam to anyone going through anything similar.  This sort of experience is not something you can or should have to deal with alone or without expert and robust help.  The managers gang together, but they don’t have Sam on their side, thankfully!

After being bullied and harassed by two co-workers in my office for many months, I became very ill with anxiety and depression, which resulted in having to take time off in order to cope.
I can’t go into the details of my case, but needless to say I was shocked at the shear lack of support and understanding when I initially reported it to my line management and employer. The longer it went on the more I was made to feel as if it was “all in my head” and “I was blowing it all out of proportion” so to speak. With no investigation carried out or disciplinary for the bully’s, I was given the silent treatment by colleagues and management and made to feel like the office pariah.
After many nights browsing on the internet in despair trying to find help, I finally found Sam’s website. Unable to sleep and in the early hours, I read what seemed like every paragraph. The following morning, I decided to give Sam a ring and leave a message. I can honestly say now, it was the best decision I ever made.
Sam got in touch with me almost immediately after he received my message. After a good chat, he calmly explained my options and guided me through the grievance process and what to do next. Sam was available day and night in spite of his very busy schedule and would always replied to all my messages with haste. It felt as if he was the only one who was on my side and we continued to work through everything together, which included the writing of my grievance letters and appeals.
He taught me how to stay calm and how to talk to my employer and its HR department. He turned things around and helped me to take control of the grievance process and he became a valuable friend with an abundant knowledge of employment law. Which is what I needed in order to fight my employer and the way in which I was being poorly treated. With his full support and guidance, every step of the way. I am now in the final stages of a very rewarding out of court settlement which will allow me to move on with my life and I can now look forward to a fresh start.
Thanks for everything Sam!

If you have been unjustly treated and suffered from bullying, discrimination work-related stress, whatever your employment issue is you have come to the right place. I  found Sam Stone through what  I can only describe as Divine intervention. For months  I had searched the Internet for help but all I could find was the information that told me that I could not fight my employer. At  2 am in the morning desperate, depressed and hopeless I came across Sam’s site and it’s the best thing that ever happened to me. At this time, at this very moment calling Sam Stone will be the best thing you do. If you work with Sam you will win. You will win Emotionally, you win financially you will get justice for whatever your employer has subjected you to. Sam’s winning mindset is contagious so make sure to catch it will help you in your fight. The last 24 months have been the most challenging and stressful time of my life. Before contacting Sam I had given up all hope. I had suffered from work-related stress, discrimination and more. The day I picked up the phone to Sam Stone my life changed. From the moment I explained my situation, he articulated back to me his thoughts. From that moment  I knew if I did not employ his services I would fail. I was right, my grievance letter was over 50 pages of pure genius, facts, case law and a line of questioning that would shock any layperson.  My grievance was partially upheld.  I was shocked and happy but that was enough. My employer did nothing to right the wrongs. I went into operation takedown and lodged an appeal. Sam Stone was unable to draft or read my appeal letter (Busy man make sure you get in there quick) but I was confident that I could do it I followed the template and his advice following our  telephone consults and did extra research. Within a month of lodging my appeal, we entered into negotiation for settlement, I am free. I am I’m free. I fought for myself and they listened. Sam Stone is an  Angel he gave me strength to fight and I won. Sam thank you so much you have changed my life and you helped me in my family live again I thank you.  Wishing you love peace light and endless abundance for you and your family.

I worked for a large NHS organisation and whilst I knew I was being treated poorly I was totally lost as to what I could do about it. Like others I found Sam’s website whilst desperately trying to find information to support me in resolving issues with my employer.
After that first conversation with Sam I finally felt someone was listening to me, someone understood how I felt. Sam’s expertise and knowledge of employment law is incredible. Truthfully, this was one of the most stressful times of my life and there were times I felt like giving up. Sam was a constant source of support. He made himself available even when he had personal priorities and no words can describe that level of commitment. Take my advice, use Sam Stones assistance. You are investing in yourself and the prospect a positive outcome.

I found Sam’s website in the early hours of the morning, after several weeks of being unable to sleep due to anxiety and worry about my employers’ behaviour towards me.  I developed a physical disability during my employment and my employer (a large corporate company) were not being helpful despite months of trying.  My endeavour’s to get help with my workplace had fallen on deaf ears and management were trying to push me out.  I had advice from a solicitor, who was cold and factual and came across as being more on my employer’s side than on mine. I scoured the internet for information and all I found were facts.  I then came across Sam’s website. Not only was there a lot of factual information about the law, but how it could actually relate to my particular situation.  I immediately knew that Sam was different; here was someone who had not just written down some legal facts in a generic way, he had shown me a way to use that information to my benefit.  After reading a few testimonials I knew he was the right person to help me.  I spoke to Sam the very next day, and he was like a breath of fresh air. He understood everything I had been through and gave me some initial thoughts, which was very helpful. I decided to take up his service of writing a grievance letter for me. It really took a weight off me, and was worth every penny.  I was so happy when I saw the letter, it was exactly what I wanted to say but could not articulate.  It had a strong punch!  Everything changed from there on in, and I managed to leave the company on terms that were favourable to me. I must admit that I was apprehensive about taking advice from a stranger on the internet, especially on such a sensitive and personal topic. I am a very cautious by nature, but I went with my gut instinct, and I am so glad I did. I could not have done this without Sam. He gave me a fighting chance and helped me stand up for myself against a big corporation. For that I cannot thank him enough. If you are wondering whether you should get in touch with him I urge you to do so. Speak to him directly and you can see for yourself. Sam supported me the whole way. He is intelligent, sharp, and knows exactly what to do at every stage. But on top of all that he is caring, compassionate and genuinely wants to help you get a good result.

I am so pleased with choosing to take Sam’s advice and counsel through a very difficult time with my employer. To trust Sam is one of the best decisions that I have ever made!
I found Sam’s website through searching the web one night desperately looking for robust information on grievance processes and employment law. I quickly read up on all the free content available on the website and soon progressed to speak to Sam directly. I felt reassured instantly as Sam quickly understood my situation, gave me some immediate advice and set time for us to speak soon again. Having Sam onboard made me feel like I had a chance against the corporation who had treated me very poorly. My employer was trying to manage me out of the business despite me being a high performer, expert in my field and an appreciated member of the team and the business. It was clearly very personal, my manager wanted me out !
Sam helped me highlight this in a constructive manner, pointing to the law, which gave me a strong position against them. We stopped them dead in their tracks and I managed to leave on terms that were favourable to me, I would not have been able to do this my self or through the sole help of a solicitor, Sam was crucial to the positive outcome!
Sam is direct, razor sharp, thorough, strategic and kind. His support was what kept me going and what gave me the strength to fight back against Goliath!
I give Sam my highest recommendation for anyone that is going through a difficult time with work. Give it a shot, start by having a call with him and you will see for yourself.
Good luck!

If you are reading this now, you may well have found yourself in a situation with your employer whereby you have been accused of wrong doing and facing disciplinary action or worse have been dismissed. Like me, you may well be experiencing sleepless nights, constant room pacing, palpitations or anxiety attacks. Like me, you may well have found grains of truth in allegations made against you which you have built in to mountains, only natural, and therefore believe you can’t fight this action. You may well belong to a union who have told you nothing can be done. Stop Now!!! You can fight this but you need help. Speak with Sam Stone immediately! He will listen calmly and sympathetically and then advise you on what action to take, and if you feel you can’t put together a formal grievance, he will do it for you for a fee, which in comparison to what solicitors’ charge is miniscule (I know because I did initially seek legal advice from solicitors). I came across Sam’s site late, one sleepless night, soon after my suspension, and to be honest I did question the validity of the testimonials (sorry Sam). In fact, continued surfing elsewhere for answers but was drawn back and eventually made that call. I am so glad I did as Sam immediately reassured me. He didn’t say I would win, at the same time Sam didn’t say I would lose. At last I felt I had someone on my side who was prepared to listen. With Sam’s help I lodged a formal grievance outlining employment breaches against me, supported by legal precedents (actual cases). It was amazing to read! Management couldn’t deal with it and had to bring in (at great cost), a consultant.
My initial grievance was rejected which set me back – I was again losing hope! Sam suggested an appeal, which I agreed to. This time it would be heard by the organisations trustees.  What can I say, I won, totally exonerated of all charges!!!   A settlement and terms were agreed within 24 hours which I was very happy with. To reach this stage I had endured 10 long stressful months with medical interventions, although I still maintained my salary, which helped.  I can now close this chapter on my life and move forward to a new one.
If you are reading this now and experiencing similar issues then my heart goes out to you. Please don’t give up!!! Get in touch with Sam. Sam can be a little blunt and say stuff that you think will wind management up and be detrimental to your case. In this respect, he can be described as the type of person who takes no prisoners and shoots all hostages (sorry Sam).  But you need to ask yourself – are management losing sleep over you, having palpitations or pacing the floor in the middle of the night after trashing your reputation???  No! But with a few, legally deliberated words from Sam, they may well be. I would like to thank Sam for everything he has done to support me over these last 10 months. I am quite happy to speak to anyone personally (over the phone) as sometimes it’s good to speak to someone who knows what you are experiencing.

I am a senior manager in a high profile construction company. I consider myself quite informed in relation to Employment Law and in having such knowledge considered myself fairly protected. However, when personally confronted by direct bullying and harassment by my employer seniors, my knowledge was quickly superseded by emotional vulnerability and desperation. The isolation I felt by such capricious action was completely overwhelming and detrimental to both me and  my family. I suffered emotionally and physically. Clearly I realised I required some professional legal advice. I came across Sam’s website purely by chance. Already feeling vulnerable, I was considerably circumspect about procuring advice from an unknown source on the internet. To offer such trust to a stranger when faced with incredibly difficult circumstances was onerous and precarious to say the least. My case, like most was complex and interspersed with inequitable actions concerning  Board members of my company. My position was highly tenuous but I had to protect my livelihood, after all I had done nothing wrong. As soon as I spoke to Sam, I knew immediately I had made the right decision in contacting him. He promptly realised and understood my position and was able to offer viable assistance. His responsiveness, limitless legal knowledge and authenticity alleviated my fear. I slept for the first time in weeks. Sam has a very practical but personal approach, he was committed and dedicated to my case. He is articulate, concise and immensely supportive. My daily conversations with him helped me enormously, for that I am indebted. One quality I really admire and respect about Sam is his honesty and transparency.  If he perceives that your intended actions aren’t in your best interest, he will not hesitate to advise against it; albeit he will determine the best possible outcome.  Due to Sam’s involvement my case reached a satisfactory conclusion, fundamentally on my terms and not my employers. My success is mostly attributable to Sam’s involvement and  his expert management of the particulars of my case. Subsequently my ‘response’ to my employer resulted in all intended formal action being rescinded. As a result, I retained my dignity and my self-worth which was priceless to me!  In doing so, I am hopeful that I have sent a clear message to my employer that bullying and harassment is wholly abhorrent in the workplace.  It’s important to remember that employer’s behaviours are predicated on ’’always getting away with it’’ but, there will always be one employee will stand up and fight.  I was that employee. Finally I would like to offer my sincerest gratitude to Sam as he allowed me to turn fear into courage and detriment into success.  “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”.

It really is so very difficult to put into words the immense impact Sam has had on my situation, however I will try to capture as best as I can.  I came across Sam’s details further to being off with work related stress which developed into severe anxiety, depression & many of the associated symptoms that go along with the illness.  I had been trying to manage contact with my company alone while on sick leave & it was becoming increasingly apparent that they were not prepared to accept that it was work related, aid my return to work correctly & they were not going to address the issues I had raised in an appropriate, reasonable manner.  Accordingly, I felt very alone, vulnerable & exposed. Sam was like a complete saviour from the moment I contacted him.  He provided excellent advice relating to my communications with my workplace ensuring that I took control of the situation, rather than being made more ill due to my employer’s reticence to help.  The invaluable part of what Sam does is certainly not just in his extensive & comprehensive knowledge of employment & associated regulatory law, but also through his absolute emotional & psychological support for my situation.  Sam never wavered from being on hand for a call & words of encouragement, inspiration & motivation.  Through some of the darkest moments of my life Sam was there to support me. Sam is highly articulate, knowledgeable & such a kind, special person that I cannot imagine how I would have got through such a traumatic period without him. My case was complex & took literally months & months to come to a satisfactory conclusion, however I know that without a shadow of a doubt that without Sam’s support I would have done exactly what my employer wanted which was to either for me to walk away & let their misdemeanours go unnoticed or indeed they would have ensured their ongoing pressure would had had me hospitalised. Sam truly deserves recognition for his never ending support & work in this field. He is the absolute best!

I came across Sam’s website after searching how to write a grievance letter. I felt a relief by reading the testimonials, because I recognized parts in many of the stories I read from other people whom had been helped by Sam. Although, I have to admit that I did have thoughts, that this might be one of those websites that the service been offered seems too good to be true. I had also some doubts because I was still in my probationary period (6 months) and therefore not very long with the company. Despite that, I was strongly convinced that the unfair way in which I had been treated at work, was not justified and in that case it doesn’t matter how long you work for your employer. I am normally a tough cookie, but unfortunately, there was nothing left of that tough cookie anymore. I was sinking into a depression. Then I decided I had to take action. I emailed Sam and he asked to phone him only 2 days later. The doubt that I described above completely disappeared during this phone conversation. I found Sam very easy to talk to, understanding, but most of all very honest. I emailed him the acts that happened to me at work and asked him to write the grievance letter. I was too stressed to do this myself and to be fair I didn’t had a clue where to start. I also wanted it to be a great letter, which would make my point clear, straight away. When I received the grievance letter from Sam, I was ecstatic and phoned my sister and said it feels already as a victory, no matter what the outcome would be. My employer upheld a part of the grievances, but not the part for unfair treatment. I was still very confident because I knew Sam was there to advise me about the best next steps. I have appealed the grievance outcome with the help of Sam. With the outcome of my grievance appeal, it seemed that my employer now really showed their true colours, because their response was kind of rude and unprofessional. Sam wrote a letter for me for a very reasonable price and asked my employer to have a discussion for a settlement agreement. My employer responded very quickly, from here it took only 1 week to come to a very satisfied settlement agreement. With my experience, I would like to say to all of you who still have doubts, do not be put off, if you hear from people/ lawyers that you don’t have a chance (I have heard that myself). If you believe you have been treated unfairly, do not hesitate and give Sam a call, because I felt he was very honest and explained me also the few weaknesses in my case. I believe if you really don’t have a chance that he would be honest about that too. You have nothing to lose. Overall, I found the money I paid for my grievance letter very well spent for the eventual outcome and closure.  I can move on now with my head held up high, up to the next job 🙂
Sam, I can’t thank you enough!!! You were a great support for me through this stressful process. I admire your professionalism and knowledge. I am also grateful for all the knowledge that I gained from it. I hope I don’t find myself again in that situation, but it does feel good to know if I do, I know where to find you. You were amazing!
Best wishes,

Dear Sam
Thanks to your help and knowledge I am happy to let you know that my wife’s employer has come to a negotiated deal that we are more than happy with. This would not have been possible without your help and advice. Your depth of knowledge and experience with employment rules and regulations really turned a bad situation round in our favour. Time and time again you were able to see how the other party were trying to manipulate the situation and each time they tried, our counter argument seemed to put them in more trouble! At first I was very sceptical about hiring someone over the internet but I had no need to have worried and would happily recommend you to anyone that finds themselves in dispute with their employer. Being able to call or email and within a couple of hours have a response really helped put our minds at rest and quite often meant that we could respond to their communications within a matter of hours. I hope I never need to call you again but would have no hesitation in doing so if the need arose!

If, like me,  you have arrived on this site after endless online  searches in the middle of the night for information/help regarding your work situation look, no further. Before finding Sam’s site I’d contacted 4 different solicitors trying to get information and help regarding the possibility of raising a grievance and ultimately negotiating a settlement to leave.  Of the one that bothered to return my call I was left feeling pretty hopeless – they didn’t seem to understand the situation at all. Imagine the relief when I phoned Sam who immediately got a grasp of the situation and explained my options, what he could help with and the next steps. Knowing that Sam was there, always responding quickly to any questions relieved so much of the stress that bringing a grievance against your employer involves. My outcome was  a very  good one for me and one  which I would never have achieved without Sam’s help.  All the best.

If you are reading this then you are probably feeling at the end of your tether from constant stress from an issue that has arisen from your workplace!
Maybe you feel bullied by your line manager, told in supervision that you’re failing your duties and your company has put you on a PIP. Or like me you have blown the whistle on some workplace wrong doing and you are being victimised for raising a genuine concern in good faith?
FEAR NOT! What we employees have is Rights!  Unfortunately our Employers do have rights to and within their rights they have a Grievance Policy for you to use to help solve such employment complaints; however this grievance procedure is very much set up in the favour of the employer such that it will use this to its advantage to help trivialise any such dispute you may have.
You may be listened to by a charming, understanding HR manager who will try and convince you that he/she is your friend and that he/she is on your side.  This cannot be further from the truth; they are there to protect the company and will do anything to limit any company liability.
When they investigate they  your grievance they will use every trick in the book to dissolve it, you can of course appeal this but again your employer has the last say and will always try and will find an excuse.
This is where Sam Stone comes in, he will write you a grievance and appeal if necessary but what Sam will do for you that you cannot do yourself is write your grievance/appeal in such a way that your employer will be stunned and will find it difficult to wriggle out of any genuine concern.  Sam will include quoted laws that have been broken as well as examples of successful Employment tribunal claims where the same laws have been broken. Straight away you will put your employer on the back foot, running for the hills!
Sam does of course charge for this service and will ask for this up front but believe me it is money well spent, you will be amazed at the detail Sam will go into on his letters and he is always available to speak to weekends included! This Man knows his stuff!
In most cases employers will be so rattled that they will look to settle out of court before things escalate to a tribunal; however with my case it involves some serious concerns and is on course for a tribunal win. This is because Sam Stone had written my grievance and appeal in such a way that my case is valid for a claim, something I could not of done myself. I have now employed a no win no fee solicitor to take my claim forward with a very good chance of winning and holding my head up high to the fact I was treated unfairly. This claim would not even go this far without the expertise of Sam Stone who I would recommend to anyone who is in my situation. Thank you so much Sam. If I ever bump into you I will certainly get you a drink or two!!

Sam has spent the last four months coaching me through one of the most difficult times of my life. I don’t know what I would have done without him. Not only did he write my grievance letter, appeal letter and all the necessary, sharply worded letters but he was also on the end of the phone and on email to me constantly with advice and guidance whenever I needed him. His words of encouragement and the work he did for me went above and beyond what I would have expected. I would highly recommend Sam to anyone who is being treated unfairly at work and needs some support in dealing with it.

If reading this testimonial, you like me were in an unfortunate position that an employer (its HR department and management) is treating you badly. It can be a very scary minefield to try navigate – trust me I know! Whilst friends and family can offer support, they don’t have the employment law knowledge that you need. Lawyers are slow, costly and ineffective. This is how my search for a trustworthy, professional whose knowledge of employment law led me to Sam Stone. Sam is one of the best in the business at employment law knowledge. He isn’t in it for the money and has integrity. His knowledge on employment law and attention to detail will leave any employer in position whereby they know you mean business. He wrote my grievance letter, emails to my employer and appeal letter. Sam gave me unbiased advice and support daily for 3 months until I reached a settlement with my employer. Sam is very direct and effective  in his dealings. He pulls no punches so be warned. Had I not worked with Sam, I honestly believe I would have resigned my position, got no reference, and be in a bad position financially. I cannot recommend Sam highly enough to anyone considering taking on an employer.  You need Sam! Money well spent.  Good luck!

Sam, you’ve been amazing to work with, like a Robin Hood in the world of work ! I can’t thank you enough. My situation is similar to a few other testimonials on this website, so without going into details I just want to say a really big thanks to Sam Stone for his outstanding service, he has been my saving grace over the last 5 months. Through the fears, tears and doubts he has helped me with my grievance letter (My grievance letter! what a letter that was !) and encouraged me to have strength in my convictions. It’s extremely difficult to do the right thing in a world of work interested in doing things ‘right’ no matter how that comprises your integrity or stress levels. Sam has an amazing knowledge and a reassuring manner and will stand beside you all the way; always there at the end of the phone when you need him. If you need some more courage and want help with grievance letters, I cannot recommend Sam highly enough.

I must commend Sam Stone’s website.  My employer wanted to the dirty on me. I was originally put on an informal PIP, this then progressed to a formal PIP, then I was fast-tracked and put under an enormous workload which became physically impossible to do. I was then referred to Sam’s website by a friend, who was helping me with my employers.  My employer wanted to fast track me out of job. My line manager  wanted me gone i.e. sacked due to alleged poor performance saving my employer money.   This was after over  11 years of service, with appraisals of proficient rating each year. All of sudden, my performance was poor.  I always seemed to be on the back foot, and my overall confidence took a severe battering.  I was practically working all the hours god could send, and I was constantly looking over my shoulder. Eventually, I was given a written warning. As far as I was concerned, I had nothing to lose but my job. I had to launch a grievance to the way I was treated.  I bought all of Sam’s templates.  Sam seemed to be on call 24 hours via email.  I was amazed.  Suddenly I took control of the situation, I was not on the back foot any more.  They tried every nasty trick to get me gone. (As Sam had predicted).  It was a nasty process, very stressful.  In the end I left with a redundancy settlement and injury to feelings settlement and a brilliant reference. I believe Sam stopped them in their tracks, if it was not for Sam’s help,  I would have been sacked, out on my ear without anything for all the years service I had given.  If you do find yourself in a similar position give Sam a try, value for money I cannot commend him enough. Thank you, thank you, thank you Sam.

I contacted Sam as a desperate situation prevailed. My husbands employers of 17 years were embarking on a new venture of amalgamating three places of work. They were changing his contract and expecting him to fall in line with all their new initiatives. When he was unable to fulfil their wishes due to his long standing disability of anxiety and depression they started intimidating him. Following a short period of sickness with anxiety and depression, they would not consider reasonable adjustments to enable him to continue  to do his job. They were regularly bullying him,  cornering him and trying to force him into over heavily manned meetings which were intimidating and oppressive. They were regularly harassing him and driving him into a corner. Internally they knew that due to his disability he would not be able to stand his ground and defend himself. They were on the road to using his fragility as a opportunity  to oppress him to the point where their actions could well have made him act unreasonably and potentially that could well have opened  the door to them having the golden opportunity of being able to remove him by way of constructive dismissal. The situation  was dire and we felt like we were in a well sinking in  slowly rising water as it began drowning us. Then our KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR arose in the distance. YES there he was THE AMAZING MAN ……… SAM STONE! Sam took everything on board for us. We discussed the difficulties my husband was facing. Sam was very understanding and after a brief conversation with Sam it felt the weight had been lifted off our shoulders.
Sam took everything on with ease he supported us. His knowledge, expertise and understanding of employment law is outstanding and second to none. He listened with enthusiasm he gave us sound  honest and professional opinion at all times. We worked together compiling all the facts and information required and constructed a grievance letter to take on the employers who where making my husbands life a misery. Sam did all the leg work with dedication and tenacity. He covered every angle from a legal perspective, including drafting a letter of appeal to appeal the grievance outcome. He had the HR Department virtually “shaking in their shoes”. Sam Stone ‘s Legal expertise, dedication and devotion resulted in us achieving an outstanding outcome and a great settlement offer. Without Sam Stone we don’t dare to think where we would be now. If your sitting there thinking and debating “shall I, or shall I leave it” DON’T! Do the email or make the call to Sam. It will be the best thing you will ever do! Believe me, justice will prevail!

I was given Sam’s contact details by a work colleague when I experienced a particularly upsetting situation with my manager while struggling with stress and depression…caused by them I may say!  Sam gave me great advice on the steps to take and ensured that the information provided in my grievance and subsequent appeal was consistent and hard hitting!  I mostly appreciated the honest conversations and no beating about the bush approach and his reliability in calling and forwarding the necessary documentation when he said he would.  It was necessary for me to employ the services of a solicitor following the grievance in order to take the situation to settlement discussion or tribunal stage and am glad to say that I achieved a favourable outcome of settlement in order to put this situation behind me which has caused me a great deal of anxiety.  It’s sad to think that after 27 years with the same employer and considering myself to be loyal and an asset to the company that I could be treated that way and my career come to an end like that but thanks to Sam pointing me in the right direction I can now look to the future with a nest egg behind me knowing that fate played a hand to move me on and it’s definitely for the best.

Finding Sam Stone was such a relief. He was able to quickly process the large volumes of information I was giving, and formulate an effective letter of grievance for me. Sam is personable and easily gained my trust in his integrity, skill and professionalism. Sam responded in a timely manner to emails and telephone calls and made the whole process as stress free as was possible. He not only impressed me with his immense knowledge of employment law, but exceeded my expectations by a million times over! The best advice I give to you all out there who has suffered detrimental treatment by their employers is , don’t bother with these blood sucking solicitors who will slowly transfuse your money out you via a drip feed. Just one grievance or appeal letter by Sam are so powerful that your employers will be rattled to the very core and will run for the hills and forced for an out of court settlement route. Thank you very much Sam for all you did. You helped me through a horrible and stressful experience, always communicated with me, and let me know at every step as what was happening and the preparations of the next steps should my employer not behave. I can certainly recommend you to anyone who finds themselves in that unfortunate position and I thank you for helping me achieve a positive outcome. I would absolutely not hesitate to consult Sam Stone again, should the need arise and will certainly be recommending him to all my colleagues and friends should they ever need to raise a grievance against their employer. Very best regard

As a BME [ Black Minority Ethnic ]and being disabled person one can imagine the difficulties that prospective employers present to us. Life is always difficult and you wonder if there is anyone out there you can turn to tackle these bastards. I found Sam!! I came across a friend and she described this gentle man who takes no bullshit from employers. I asked for Sam’s number and I called him on a Sunday. Obviously this was a pot luck call and to my surprise Sam answered and asked me to call him back at a certain time. I called him and within seconds he knew exactly what I was attempting to express to him. Within minutes he was already constructing my defence and grievance. Within weeks Sam had produced letters for me to intimidate my employers and place them on the back foot.  Miraculously they raised their head to listen. I had gained back some control and self-respect. My union were already in collusion with my employers and trying very hard to keep their romance intact whist being ‘seen’ to serve their members. So I needed someone who could protect me. Sam wanted to be paid upfront for pieces of work and that was my only worry initially. However he delivered much more and hence forth I was comfortable with the money side. Sam’s methodology is very much like ‘a bull in a china shop’ but the Bull is a martial artist. He knows the moves in law so well and I had to spend weeks reading up these laws. Even my employers and the employment judges were perplexed at my Formal grievance that Sam had written for me. I wish I was a fly on the wall when my employers opened my Grievance letter. My union would not have done a fraction of the research. I had spent a little more money than I initially thought, but upon looking back at the attention to detail Sam out in, I could not grumble. Sam’s charges are very reasonable compared to high street solicitors but more accessible and always at the end of the phone. Strangely sometimes I will call him just to hear him rant about stuff. I would recommend Sam to anyone who wants justice and wants the Employers to feel a bit of their own medicine whilst getting justice for their poor treatment of you.

I first contacted Sam following a recommendation from a friend and my first question to Sam was will I be successful. He replied – “without me you have  no chance but with me you have a chance”. Never a true word has been spoken! I felt so uncertain and out of my comfort zone thinking what am I throwing at my hard earned money at this but seriously I am a conservative individual it took me time to get my head around it and this was because I was challenging a County Council who are one of the hardest employers to deal with. The journey was horrendous I made myself ill with worry for both myself
and my family. I suffered from anxiety and depression and finally after a really difficult 10 months of fighting, uncertain any, heartache and despair the Council with Sam’s support grievance letters and guidance I was able to reach an outcome. Based on the letters that Sam wrote to me to send I to my employer left it clear that their responses they finally they took me seriously and now I have opted to take voluntary redundancy which was never on offer at the onset. I would recommend Sam Stone to you on every level without hesitation and would use Sam’s experience and knowledge to help you to beat your bullies and achieve an admirable outcome.

Sam is incredibly helpful and I have no hesitation in recommending him to anyone facing the might of their employer with a grievance.
I was initially sceptical about using Sam as all his testimonials are very positive and my standards are high, but from initial contact through to achieving a settlement with my employer he has been there for me. He is not just knowledgeable about the legislation but he cares deeply about the employee’s  rights.  Sam doesn’t just point you to the relevant legislation but guides you through writing the appeal. He responds promptly to questions and queries and is always there to offer advice and support.  His attitude towards me was in high contrast to the one from the Union rep, who behaved appallingly throughout the process.  Using Sam’s knowledge and understanding of employment legislation was a key feature of my defence and I am in no doubt as to its weight in convincing my employer of the many mistakes they had committed and was strategic in making them settle without the need for an ET.

I have been and still am a union rep for the biggest union in the UK. I work in the not for profit i.e. charity sector. My employer is without doubt the most uncharitable, although they like to say they are ‘accountable’ have ‘values’ and are striving to be a best practice employer. I’ve been on many courses to enable me to ‘rep’ the members, but I can honestly say those courses taught me absolutely nothing of use in the battle of employee vs employer. So I started to look on line for ‘grievance template’ as my Union didn’t have such a thing. I found Sam.
I read everything he’s written on all the different topics and I have learnt far more than any course I’ve been on! All his templates are without doubt the most helpful, insightful and help you win an argument/disciplinary with your employer, but as he says unless they have breached a law or regulation then its probably not going to help to go in guns blazing. Please be in no doubt his templates state the law and they state very clearly what is expected of the employer. I’ve used Sam to help me with a member who was being systematically bullied and put on yet another PIP by her line manager who has an ulterior motive to get her out to save redundancy. Through the Union my hands were tied by the ‘they can do that’ and ‘it’s a process’ rubbish by my Union officer.
I told her to contact Sam and she did straight away. Sadly, I cannot be her support/rep now as its a conflict of interest, but I wont let that stop me supporting her, and thanks to Sam, she feels totally heard and understood. Don’t hesitate to use his templates and if necessary call him.

Sam Stone’s knowledge, expertise and understanding of employment law is outstanding. He listened to my case and gave his honest and professional opinion at all times. We worked together compiling all the facts and information required to document my grievance letter to the company. Sam supported me through thick & thin and met all deadlines promised, on time. And delivered to me exceptional support in very trying circumstances. My grievance letter was amazing. Factual, to the point and covered by law parlance. Sam covered every aspect I wanted conveyed to my employer and much more. Which resulted in an acceptable outcome after a long hard battle. This enabled me to walk away head held high as the right outcome was achieved after some poor treatment by the company concerned. I cannot thank Sam enough for his support and professionalism. Without which my experience would have been considerably worse at the hands of corporate intransigence. I can honestly say. That this, has been the most difficult part of a long and distinguished career in engineering that I have ever had to endure.
However, with a guy like Sam Stone in your corner you are not alone. I have come to regard Sam as friend and would hopefully share that beer with him as promised. Cheers Sam   If you are reading this review and are the victim of bullying, harassment, work related stress or management manipulation tactics. Then Sam is the man for you. He stands for the underdog when so many sway the other way. My final piece of advice is. DO NOT cave in to corporate dominance as so many people do.
REMEMBER – YOU have Sam Stone to call on.
May 2016
I first contacted Sam in July 2015 to get some advice about a grievance I planned to raise with my employer. He quickly pinpointed the crux of my complaints from an employment law perspective and helped me draft a compelling grievance letter and evidence. Although my employer did not accept my complaints they did acknowledge they had never seen a grievance written like mine before. I believe this was because Sam really gave it teeth and put them on the back foot. Sam helped me draft an appeal, and prepare for meetings with my employer. All of these put my employer under further pressure and last week they agreed a substantial settlement with me to avoid us going to a full hearing in a tribunal. I don’t believe I could have achieved this result without Sam’s help. He helped me to understand the issues and express them in the best way. He was always available by phone and gave me the confidence and the tools to hold my employer to account. I can’t thank him enough.

If you are being bullied, harassed or suffering from work-related stress and all informal ways of raising concerns have failed then you need to think about putting in grievance. What I would say is please do not do this lightly because you need to be prepared to leaving your organisation as a result. If this is the right route for you then where do you start, what do you say? You only have one chance and you need to get it right. This is where Formal Grievance can help. Write down your story and download the templates from Sam’s website and I will guarantee you will have one the most articulate and well written grievances your organisation has ever received. They will have to take you seriously. My own story was one of work-related stress and anxiety arising from a huge workload and a poor manager. I was burned out, ill and exhausted and then when I didn’t think things could get any worse they tried to force me out with a sham redundancy. Happily we reached a resolution where I could walk away with my head held high. I could not have got through this without the templates and help from Sam Stone. I would be lying if I didn’t say its one of the hardest things I’ve ever been through but through this process I’ve learned the problems at work were not my fault. I no longer blame myself. Above all, its given me back my self belief and confidence to take forward into my next role.

Sam Stone is just as fantastic as all the reviews state. He’s like an oxygen blast through my head! I had spent a lot of money on Lawyers prior to talking to Sam which I now regret. My advice – take the leap and give Sam a call. He will work harder and give your case more attention than any lawyer, he’s always on the phone when you need him and gives outstanding guidance and a frank opinion. My employers entered into a settlement agreement with me earlier than expected and Sam even refunded me for the work I paid him to do on this basis. He gives the best guidance – even if it’s him that looses out! Sam gave me the time and attention I had craved for when I really needed it. He wants to thoroughly understand your grievances and has the expertise in law to know exactly the best way forward. He’s the people’s champion and he’s passionate about helping others get justice. Don’t hesitate – talk to the chap and you’ll know what I mean! Thank Sam!

They say a little goes a long way, and this has never been truer than my situation with Sam. I , like many others before me, stumbled across his site at a time when my job at the previous employer was in a perilous state, with the campaign of abuse going up several notches prior to enough being enough. I was ready to quit, life had become unbearable and they knew it. They were also ready to take advantage of the fact I was still on probation and terminate me with a 1 week notice, thinking that there was not a slight chance I could win, given that an employee cannot claim constructive dismissal having been at the company for less than 2 years. However, the small print, which employers usually deploy to hurt an employee, came back to haunt them. Immediately, Sam put my mind at rest, told me to invoke section 44, and how the invoking of it practically ties the company’s hands. Given that I had lost trust in everyone, I was still sceptical. He explained to me that there are certain circumstances that override the 2 year rule, with this being one of them. From this point on, the balance of power flipped over-night. What sounded too good to be true was in fact not, and to use a boxing analogy, having had me on the ropes late on Friday afternoon, they should have not allowed me to survive that weekend. Armed with this knowledge, and newly found power, I decided that getting out of this place with a job either on the same pay or even less would be the priority, for my own sanity and the fact that it would also look good on me had this gone to tribunal. Needless to say, I managed to secure a job elsewhere, resign on my own terms, using the short notice period I was on to full advantage and releasing myself from this unscrupulous employer’s grip in quick fashion. Moreover, I had also been accruing holiday despite taking time off. It gets even better, as despite my resignation, one of their HR people mentioned a settlement agreement to me, something I at the time didn’t know about the existence of. He then tried to act all pally with me, claiming that trust wasn’t broken, despite outlining in my resignation letter that it was. His arrogant and underhanded behaviour continued, which led to me appealing the incredibly biased outcome, leading to an agreement which leaves me quite a bit better off economically.  The money I spent with Sam gave me a security blanket, helped me to get a better job and a settlement agreement out of this particular bunch. But above all else, it gave me the confidence and knowledge to defend myself going forward. Mr. Stone, you truly are the people’s champion, and I don’t think that the unscrupulous like what the Stone is cookin’.

When I came across Sam’s site, it was as if a light had been turned on in what to then was the dark room of my life. He listened, he empathised and he gave me his honest and professional opinion. I had no doubt that this man would be the only way forward in taking forward a grievance with a very difficult employer. He kept every promise, he met every deadline, and led me through a grievance process that I would have struggled with if acting alone. He laid all the foundations (set the stage) for what ultimately proved to be a very successful unfair dismissal and discrimination case, which my solicitor handled. I could not recommend this man highly enough. He was my advisor and confidant, and although he sometimes had to tell me things I didn’t want to hear, Sam fought for me and believed in me. Thanks Sam, you’re a real star and a great guy.

Like many others, I came across Sam’s site by pure accident. I was off sick for the third time in as many years with a stress related illness and was at the end of my tether. I loved my job but the concerns I had raised to management regarding my health had been constantly ignored. As per company procedure, my next cause of action was to submit a grievance; unfortunately I didn’t have a clue how to go about it! Thankfully lady luck was on my side that night as the first link I clicked on took me to Sam’s site. After sitting up most of the night reading through the information Sam had provided on his site regarding the grievance process, it soon became clear that it was a lot more complex than I imagined. To be honest, I felt totally overwhelmed and in desperation sent Sam an email outlining my situation, asking if he could help me write my grievance. Imagine my surprise when I received an email back within half an hour asking him to call him the next morning, which was a Sunday. I can’t imagine a solicitor doing that! Within minutes of talking to Sam, it was absolutely clear that a) he knows his stuff and, perhaps more importantly, b) he’s on your side. Over the space of around an hour he explained in great detail the grievance process, how it’s completely weighted in the employer’s favour and the importance of submitting a solid initial grievance. Sam wrote my grievance letter for me and asked me to send him a statement and a few documents outlining my grievances. His fee was incredibly reasonable, especially compared to what a solicitor would charge and I felt confident that I had made the right decision.
Three weeks later, exactly as promsed, my grievance letter was completed. Sam called me and talked me through the process and then sent me my letter via email. To say it was a masterpiece would be an understatement – I actually broke down in tears after reading it due to the sense of relief I felt. Sam has an incredible way with words and even I, with very little employment law knowledge, could see that the employer was in deep trouble.  Because I am under an NDA I would prefer not to go into too much detail regarding the grievance process itself, but what I will say is that with only Sam’s grievance letter and his ongoing support, I managed to obtain a five figure settlement sum and a decent reference from my former employer. Due to the utmost confidence I had in Sam, I didn’t ever feel the need to refer to a solicitor, even though I was up against the (very expensive) corporate law firm. While they did have a few tricks up their sleeve, Sam has seen it all before and countered them with ease. Within 4 months it was all done and dusted and I walked away with my head held high.  Without Sam, none of the above would have been possible and I cannot thank him enough. There were times during the process where I did have my doubts and felt like giving up, but Sam was always there to offer support. If you are in a similar situation to me, do yourself a favour and contact Sam, I can assure you you won’t regret it.  Thanks again Sam, make sure you let me know when you are next down in my neck of the woods, I owe you a beer (or six)!

I came across the formal grievance site in the middle of the night when I could not sleep after submitting my grievance complaint against my employer; who chose not to take the matter seriously.    Upon emailing Sam in the wee hours of Saturday night by Sunday morning I had a response.   We chatted at length on the Monday morning and within an hour I instructed Sam to take forward my grievance. The testimonials on this site are indeed echoed by me.  Sam helped me every step of the way even at my grievance hearing Sam was at the end of the telephone providing full reassurance expertise , guidance and comfort despite me at times being too emotional to talk. Sam is the fighting crusader for grievance processes against employers; he shows empathy and is fully knowledgeable in employment law and leaves no stone unturned.  As a senior manager who was working for a large organisation fighting for reasonable adjustments to be made following my return to work after  cancer.  I would say forget the impersonal high street lawyer.  If you feel you have been treated unfairly and looking for someone to  fight your corner look no further. Despite the pain and anguish my case was settled after two letters written by Sam.   I am now able to move on with my life.    Without him I would be still subdued to the dirty tactics of my previous employer who paid lip service to their policies and statutory law. If you are reading this testimonial as I did, with countless others below, you have nothing to loose but get in touch as I did. Good luck – Sam you are a hero.

Hi Sam
From your loyal  Rottweiler!!! From one day to the other I was escorted off the premises like a criminal. I was suspended pending a disciplinary meeting. I was in a real state; the unfairness, didn’t know what to do. I found formalgrievance.com online and bought the Grievance Letter. I emailed Sam and he asked me to ring back on a Sunday morning! Sam’s advice and an email to HR led to a quick corridor agreement (they were on the phone the same day). Not sure what I would have done without Sam’s help. For me it is a big goodbye to the corporate world. Never again. Thank you Sam. xxx Rupal from Hampshire.

It’s taken me a while to write this, I’ve been so keen to put what has been a very difficult process behind me.  But I do want to say how incredibly grateful I am to Sam for helping me more than I thought possible.  I will keep this brief but I was at the end of my tether at work and just about ready to throw in the towel and resign putting me and my family in a precarious financial position.  I knew I was being treated very badly by my boss but I had no idea whether or not I had a legitimate legal case. When the lawyers provided by my home insurance came back saying I didn’t have a case I thought that was really the end of the line.  One morning I was googling (again) work place harassment and I found the website for Sam.  I felt I had nothing to lose and gave him a call.  He was blunt, tenacious and straight to the point.  More than any of the lawyers I had tentatively explored I knew he would help me.  I was nervous because it’s not the normal process to deal with someone that isn’t a lawyer, but I would recommend Sam to anyone.  My formal grievance and subsequent appeal that I had submitted to my work myself had not had the desired impact at all.  One document from Sam and everything began turning my way.  Within three weeks I was out of the company and had a settlement agreement I was happy with.  It was a horrible period of my life but I’m so pleased I found Sam (and his wife!).  I now have a new job and have put it all behind me.  Thanks again Sam,

If you are reading this you will probably now be aware that your current career could be coming to an end. It has probably been happening for sometime and is gathering momentum. You probably have an exemplary performance and attendance record until recently where now you can’t do anything right…work colleagues are distancing themselves from you….Line Manager is giving you his/her undivided attention…. you feel ill…depressed…paranoid…That was me….I had suspected for a while something wasn’t right.
Unfortunately I cannot discuss my situation due to legal constraints but believe it or not I’m one of the lucky ones…I slipped through a tried and tested formula practised by senior management to discard and ruin the lives of people who work within the company.
I found Sam and from the  first time I spoke to him I felt safe. He told me what was happening to me was common and is happening every minute of every day in all walks of life. He told me what I was experiencing with my mental and physical condition was normal for someone  going through this hell…to find someone who understands you is a relief and as you read through the testimonials, there are many people who Sam and his wife Amy have helped and the numbers are growing. Sam understands what you are going through as he and Amy have been in this position…. he views your situation with professionalism and objectivity and is so sharp with Employment Law that he can keep you on course when your employer turns to dirty tactics as I found out from my experience. I and my husband could not have got through this without Sam and Amy. We owe them a debt of gratitude.
You will get through this, both you and you’re family. You will come out this stronger with your head held high and your character and career intact.
Be strong and don’t let them destroy you…don’t let them get away with it!!!.
Thank you

Words cannot really express my gratitude for the help you provided me in my time of need, by doing my grievance letter.  You guided me through the landmine grievance process. You never wavered in helping me make the right decisions even though the process took 9 months to resolve. You are a huge support in troubled times and for that I will  be ever grateful to you.
I am now rebuilding my life and able to focus on the future. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I came across Sam quite by accident when I was searching the internet on how to write a formal grievance letter. I contacted him and knew straight away that this man knew what he was talking about and could help me. I was extremely stressed and Sam helped relieve some of that stress with his no nonsense approach and sense of humour (which you need when you are stressed!)
I got the outcome I wanted and am now in a great place, deciding what I want to do next.  I read some testimonies before I called Sam and one of them says something like this. “If he is booked up, wait and if you can’t afford him, save…. I couldn’t agree more, Sam you have been my guardian angel over the past few months and I can’t thank you enough. Keep on with the brilliant work you are doing because you are helping people change their lives for the better. ”

I came across Sam’s website, after receiving my grievance hearing outcome letter.  Which quite frankly was a whitewash and a sham.  I’d been putting up with bullying and disability discrimination by my employer, for a number of years.  Then finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and went off sick with stress at work, which then lead to depression. I naively thought that by reporting this matter to my company’s HR dept, that something would get done about this bully, but unfortunately it didn’t! So once I received the outcome letter, I knew I had to appeal their decision.  Initially, I purchased Sam’s grievance appeal letter and read through  it.  It was as if it had be written for me.  Then I rang Sam, who put me at eases straight away.  We discussed my case and I drafted the appeal letter then Sam did the rest!  It ended up being 28 pages long! Suffice to say work ended up offering me a settlement, without the need for an ET claim. I really don’t know what I would have done without Sam’s support and guidance throughout this awful ordeal.  It was so nice to feel like I had someone supporting me and  helping me every step of the way!  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Sam, to anyone.  He has been truly amazing.
Thank you, Sam.

Sam has proved to be the best person we could have found in helping us fight my Husband’s employers.  Every step of the way Sam has been understanding, knowledgeable, helped us avoid all the pitfalls and been a friendly ear when we’ve needed it.  Without Sam I do not think my Husband would have secured a decent payout from the ACAS early conciliation service. At times of need, for example when you’re world turns upside down when you are on the brink of loosing your job, you need to have people you can trust and really care about getting a decent outcome for you.  We found Sam really cared about helping bring my Husband’s employment problems to a good conclusion.  Without a doubt, we would not have got through this awful experience without Sam.  Thank you!

After having suffered bullying and exclusion by my manager and employer for several years, my health began to suffer the consequences of prolonged stress.  This led me to suffer even more discrimination and harassment as my health and confidence deteriorated.  After 12 months of suffering ill health and discrimination, getting nowhere with meeting after meeting with HR and my line manager, I felt I had no choice but to put in a Grievance.  I was hesitant to do this because I knew that it could turn into the point of no return but felt I had been left with no choice. I was being bullied out of a job that I had been happy at for over 10 years and had to defend my corner. I did a search on “how to do a Grievance letter” and I thank my lucky stars (and Google) for stumbling across Sam Stone’s website.  After reading his testimonials, of which there were many and recent ones at that, I gave Sam a call to discuss my situation. Sam immediately made me feel secure in the fact that he knew what he was talking about. He was so knowledgeable on the subject and explained the law and how my employer had failed me. It was good to have confirmation of what I believed to be the case.  Sam also explained the process from start to finish and the likely steps that the company would take to belittle me and lead me into saying things that they could use against me at a later date. Sam explained that the process was like a game of chess whereby my employer knew the rules of the game…a game of which I knew nothing about. I would always be at the losing end of the game as I had never experienced this before.  Sam guided me every step of the way and every time I got an email from them I would contact Sam for guidance on how to answer the email so as to avoid falling into their traps.  Even still, I was shocked at how low they stooped and the farce in dealing with my Grievance.
My case ended up being filed for a Tribunal, so I retained a lawyer, but my lawyer was not as dynamic as Sam.  I know 100% that if I had not had Sam at the end of the phone or email that I could not have got through this very harrowing and stressful situation. The process took around 8 months in total and there was not one point whereby Sam was not available to guide and advise me night or day. The end result that was achieved would not have been possible without Sams’ guidance and for that I will be eternally grateful.   Sam was worth every penny that I paid him and more! I would recommend that you contact Sam as he will definitely give you the best chance of winning your case.  He will tell you if you stand a good chance or not honestly.  Sam became a lifeline for me and I would love to meet him personally one day to buy him a drink or 2!  I would go as far as to call him a superhero!  I would be very happy for Sam to put us in touch should you wish to speak to me in more detail as I cannot begin to write just how much he helped me.
Eternally grateful in London.

Sam Stone is the patron saint of disempowered employees, no one else is fighting our corner like Sam.
Even though I read the website and the warnings here before I submitted a formal grievance, I expected my employer would take my grievance seriously. I’d worked for them for 27 years, I felt I had some influence, my grievance was justified, I was sure they would listen.  It was a shock to be the victim of a sham investigation, horrible delaying tactics and management lies, they didn’t listen at all and my grievances weren’t upheld. I asked Sam to help me with my appeal letter, we got to 26 pages and it was so satisfying pulling apart my employers grievance response! That was what made them sit up and take notice and I did get heard, I came away with a great settlement but the process took agonising months and is not something I would’ve managed on my own.
On the surface what Sam does is provide employees with tools to help them take on their employer but actually he does so much more. He gave me as much support as I needed, I’d drop him a quick email/text when ever I had a query and he would ping straight back. He was much more cost effective, approachable and knowledgeable than the arrogant solicitor I saw. I got patchy advice from ACAS and no help at all from the HSE but Sam knows what he is talking about. The system is all set up to favour employers who continue to flaunt laws as there is no come back on them but Sam can help you take them on and play them at their own game. I felt he had huge empathy for the emotional strain of my situation but was a straight enough talker to tell me if I was wrong about something.  Its important to me to be able to look back on a traumatic event like the formal grievance process and think I did the best I could in the circumstances. Sam Stone enabled me to do that. Do yourself a favour and get in touch with him. I cannot thank him enough as I am free now.

With the thought of a final level looming of works sickness system I knew deep down it could be curtains, but thought hang on, I haven’t done anything wrong, yes I have been sick, but what have they done? Nothing apart from go through the system. They had form for making an example out of people (in my book). So in March time, I think, I googled and found Sam Stone. I was sure I had a case, but then doubted I had. So with thinking is Sam Stone real? You see so many people get conned and the internet is a risk. Well the solicitor I had paid a few hundred pounds too was a complete waste of money, so I took the risk. Pleased? Oh yes I am, VERY. Sam is fab, a real one in a million and very attentive and at cost, he put together a great 16 page grievance letter for me. It was outstanding. There was no way I could have done it. I so wish I could have been a fly on the wall when the powers of be read it. The letter was given in in March 2015. As I write this 22/6/15 the deal is done, I’ve been paid off, without the need to go to tribrunal and that is the end of a very distressing and anxious chapter.  Sam Stone and Amy, thank you for all your help, both with this horrible chapter and for health advise. These 2 are angels and I can’t praise them enough. Sam, I have put your name forward already.
Many thanks & Very best wishes P & K x

2014 was the start of the most traumatic, unforeseen and undeserved event of our lives. My husband – an honest, loyal and hardworking man had been subjected to systematic campaign of bullying designed to undermine his health, his career and a job he had dedicated himself to for more than ten years – and all instigated by the firm’s brand new Managing Director.  Matters came to a head on weekend at the end of April.  We were faced with the very real prospect that my husband would be fired first thing Monday morning, having been royally ‘set-up’ by the MD and his team of senior managers the week before.  By the time Sunday morning arrived, we were beside ourselves not knowing what to do, where to turn, what my husband’s rights were or who we might turn to to uphold them.  That’s when I found Sam Stone, quite by chance, trawling Google in an attempt to find a lifeline, any lifeline, any tiny shred of help! In true Sam style, despite the fact that it was Sunday, Sam asked me to ring him (once he’d completed the weekly supermarket assault and tackled the usual household chores). Sam listened, Sam understood, Sam didn’t pay lip service, Sam made us feel as though we were not alone.  He gave a realistic, objective and pragmatic interpretation of our situation and helped us determine what to do next.  He cautioned that a ‘happy ever after’ was unlikely and that my husband, in fact anyone who finds themselves in similar circumstances, has every right to uphold their principals and stand up for what is right.  To cut a very long story short, Sam was there for us at every turn. Not only does he have an encyclopaedic knowledge of employment law, a canny way with words and an enviable letter writing talent, he’s also is there for ‘the person’- the victim who is afraid, hurt and bewildered. He offers pastoral care that without doubt enabled us to survive, relatively unscathed, what turned out to be eight months of.. well…. Hell, actually. Whether we won or lost (with Sam’s guidance we were able to settle out of court), is not the point.  The point is that without Sam we would have lost the fight even before it began.  Thanks to Sam, my husband was able to hold his head up and take a stand against the injustice of unscrupulous employers and the indifference of the ‘system’.

Hi Sam, I wanted to Thank you for your help and advice with my grievances against my employer. It is finally over, I do not want to look back at the past but looking forward to new beginnings.
It has been very stressful time but your help and guidance made the situation clearer and easier to bear. I would certainly recommend you to any of my friends or family. You have deep knowledge and understanding of the Employment law and how system works. You are also a person who cares about other people who got into a difficult situation and help them to fight unfairness. So thank you very much for all your help! Best regards – Tina

I almost feel that writing a testimonial will never do justice to my experience with the man they call Stone. It was pure luck that I chanced upon Sam Stone’s website. Being faced with the end of a successful 30 year career simply through having told the truth was worse than devastating, it was going to destroy me. I knew I had to defend myself and fight back but that’s hard when you don’t have the tools. So that lucky day when I came across
www.formalgrievance.com
seemed like something that made immediate sense. Easy, buy the template and at least I can make a fist of defending myself. And then somewhere I noticed that Sam could do more than provide you with a standard letter…much more. I will remember that day as the start of my new life although at the time my state of health didn’t allow me to have any belief that I could fight and win. Sam talked me through every aspect of my grievance and pending disciplinary. He lived it and breathed it but best of all he believed it. His knowledge of the law would impress the best solicitors and even barristers, but even more of a tribute is his ability to adapt and learn. He is a reflective practitioner whose approach will leave any deviant employer quaking every time the email sound chimes on their computer. My case saw off five HR consultants and their in-house solicitor. The management team, including the CEO had to invest to keep up and that is what is so impressive about Sam. Whereas the unscrupulous employer will attempt to convince you that your rights have not been undermined, Sam holds up a mirror so they get to see each and every flaw as their case came crashing down around them as it did in my case. I can thank Sam for helping me effectively win against my employer, and for helping to ensure that I can continue in my chosen career, and for helping me stand up on my own two feet. The things I would like to thank Sam for are not the things I can share with you, so my friend that will have to remain a secret between us. Use Sam Stone as you get very few chances to fight back whether internally or through employment law, and if you want to fight back then you won’t do better that sharing your story with Sam first. Good Luck

For the first time in my career I was forced to start grievance proceedings against my employer. I did not belong to a union until later so I turned to the internet to help me write a grievance letter. In my search Sam’s website came up in the top results and as I read his pages I found them to be so informative and putting other websites to shame that I stopped looking any further. I felt confident that I had found the right help in pursuing my grievance as the pressure lifted off and I felt less helpless. I contacted Sam thereafter for guidance and he reassured me that in his opinion my grievance was classed as discrimination under the Equality Act. I went on to buy the Grievance Letter template and I was so relieved because not only did it help me understand the whole grievance procedure more clearly but it warned me about the loopholes HR would use to protect its employer from liability. I felt the template helped me to stay one step ahead in the game as I began to understand my own rights and the law. I can’t express how brilliant Sam’s grievance letter was that I got a “wow” from my Union Rep. I went on to purchase the Grievance/Disciplinary Hearing template as my case progressed which further aided me to confidently challenge HR and submit evidence at my hearing. I had so much faith in Sam that I had already purchased the Appeal Letter template in advance and when I received my grievance outcome Sam’s template covered what to expect, the next step of action to take and how to put forward a watertight appeal. To say Sam has helped me each step of the way is an understatement with his encouraging advice and support, he truly is an amazing guy and his knowledge on Employment Law is outstanding! Even when I did join the union Sam’s advice took precedent over my Union Rep’s who did not question my confidence in him as he guided me. If you are beginning your journey all I can say is without Sam’s templates I would have put forward a weak case and most likely given up, so by investing in such reasonably priced templates you are already laying down the right foundations in your grievance and giving yourself the best fighting chance to win!
Thank you Sam

If you’ve arrived at this page you are probably in the same position I was in 2014. I was suffering from workplace harassment and discrimination, signed off work and lost in a world of grievances and disputes, paying through the nose for lawyer’s fees but feeling like I was going nowhere. I knew I had to write a formal Grievance Letter to my employer, but did not have a clue about how to go about it. I suspected that if I got it wrong, the employer, with their lawyers and HR people paid to do this sort of thing, would find it much easier to dismiss it out of hand. I came across Sam’s site after a google search, and after reading these same references you are now reading, I contacted him hoping that at last I could get some proper real world guidance. I can honestly say it was the smartest move I made and I would not be in the position I am now in without his empathy, support and guidance. The only advice I can give you if you are in a similar situation is just do it, make contact with Sam now. You literally have nothing to lose other than cost of a phone call. Sam has trodden this path with his clients countless times, and can and will help you. He not only helps with the detail of how the process works but also by giving reassurance based on an encyclopaedic knowledge of the process and how employers are likely to behave. He is not a lawyer but he knows the law better than any lawyer I have ever met. You are not alone.

There could never be sufficient words to express our gratitude to Sam.  I had been subjected to the most awful bullying and harassment and I had exhausted the company’s internal processes (internal sham, formal sham, appeal sham etc..). As it happens a colleague of ours had recommended Sam – yup the employer  had learnt no lessons from past grievances so Sam was familiar with how the company operated and the characters involved which made explaining our case a little easier.  We have also recommended a colleague to Sam since – yup they still haven’t learnt.
Our union was of no help whatsoever, quite often they would undermine our position as they did not have the experience or competence to face up to HR or the senior management team. Sam did. He very quickly assessed the case, anticipated their strategy and gave his unwavering support to us, always at the end of a phone/Skype and even pulling all-nighters in order to arm us with confidence and arguments and rebuttals. Sam understands the law, make no mistake he is more than able to go head-to-head with any HR representative, more importantly he is able to explain the law in a way that is relevant and makes sense. Contacting Sam saved us from ourselves, our mental health and our marriage. Our doubts and fears had made it impossible for us to continue as we felt we were fighting the whole world (company). The biggest compliment we could give Sam is that he can even things up for you no matter who the opposition is. We are thankful some multi-national doesn’t hire him to fight their fires! I once raised this with Sam as a career alternative, he just looked at me and said  “I could never bring myself to work for those ********”. He is for and of the people completely, justice and helping people is what motivates him.  We cannot thank you enough Sam, if only everyone was as generous, decent and moral as you the world would be an amazing place.

A friend of mine recommended Sam to me when I was having difficulties at work. These issues had been recurrent for 3 years and I had raised several grievances but the issues persisted and led to ill health due to the bullying and harassment I suffered. Sam responded quickly to my first text and called me later. He listened to all I had to say and was such a sympathetic listener. He then told me that I had a good case although it was quite complex and we started our work together. He was upfront about the cost and he delivered what he promised. Working with Sam gave me an understanding of the law. He was supportive all the way and always had positive words of encouragement for me when I felt very low. Even when I got my lawyer involved, she said I had done a lot of work which made her work easier. I followed Sam’s advice and we reached a favourable outcome. The help I got from Sam was more than I could have obtained from any lawyer. I have not met Sam in person but you can rest assured that you are dealing with someone who is truly professional and genuine. I want to use this opportunity to say ‘thank you’ to Sam. God truly used you to be a warrior for the weak and a defender of the defenceless.

We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation for the support of Sam Stone at
www.formalgrievance.com
. Not only are the templates really helpful, Sam’s advice and knowledge is truly priceless.
If you have any question whether you can trust the advice from someone “invisible” on a website, this thought can be instantly and resoundly dismissed when you find Sam Stone – a true professional and realist who has vision and restores your belief when you think others are doubting you. Thank you for your assistance in producing a robust formal grievance and appeal letter content that led to the right outcome. At each stage you gave reassurance and solid advice.  Your steadfast resolve helped us through.
Thank you Mr & Mrs S

Here I am nine months after and the relief to me grows with each passing day. You gave me support, encouragement and advice which, in hindsight, has demonstrated itself to be the best outcome. Where you differ from others, I believe, is that I have always considered that my basic needs at the time – strength, empowerment, wisdom and knowledge – were being met in abundance, thanks to your support Sam. Looking back on my experience, the journey I was on was extremely difficult. It was – and is – a rocky, choppy, minefield out there, with little time to research what you are dealing with, let alone whom you choose to help you deal with it. That is why, still with incalculable relief nine months later, I still feel compelled to write and let you and readers of your website know just how fortuitously happy I am, to have chosen you at the time. I do not believe there is a person on the planet who could write better for anyone being bullied or victimised at work. Just go with Sam. You won’t regret it.

I have just received a five figure settlement sum in connection with the Sexual Harassment, Bullying and Victimisation that I had been enduring at work. I had been to hell and back again. I was ill, lost and confused and did not know where to turn. Then I found Sam’s website, I had written (what I immediately realised after reading Sam’s) the most dreadful letter of grievance. Sam’s (15 page) letter was astounding, brilliant – I am convinced that without Sam’s help, I would not have been taken seriously, and that I would not have received a penny.  Sam raised the bar. He understood, he knew exactly what games would be played, and how and when they would be. From my distress, Sam understood what had been, and also what was happening to me-even better than I did myself!  and he knew exactly what to do about it, when I simply did not. Whatever was ‘thrown’ at me – Sam was immediately responsive, he knew exactly what to do. The knowledge that he has cannot be beaten, he was always/always there, always supportive, he was by my side 100% of the way. He kept me strong and got me through the most horrendous ordeal. I did not know Sam when I turned to him- and I was scared, but I am so glad that I put my trust in him, he never let me down. Here is a man who can be trusted and counted upon. He worked tirelessly on my case. I am so glad that I ‘stumbled’ upon his website. It is not an understatement to say that Sam has turned my life back around, and restored my confidence. Now I can look forward and I cannot thank him enough.

I first contacted Sam in January 2014 after spending the previous 12 months prior watching my wife’s health deteriorate drastically whilst trying to fight a large multinational company where she’d been employed for 17 years. From the first telephone conversation with Sam I was hooked and knew he was the one that could help us. We had tried solicitors, Union, etc. but no one was actually interested in what we had to say. We thought we had a good case, but just needed someone to believe in us, actually listen to what we were saying and give us some honest and truthful guidance without feeling intimidated, all of which Sam did so well.
In my wife’s case her employer had throughout the grievance procedure tried every unbelievable dirty trick in the book from some serious intimidation/bullying, withholding information, to pretending they always had her interests at the forefront of their treatment of her etc. Sam really knows his stuff about employment law. Sam wrote or talked us through every stage of the grievance process and was so approachable which helped my wife so much as she was ready to give up due to the anxiety and depression she was going though. On many occasions Sam doubled as our therapist and talked us into not throwing the towel in which we are immensely grateful for. I’ll not lie by saying our situation was easy by any means, we lost a couple of the battles, which seriously rocked our confidence, but after speaking with Sam we came back and eventually won the war!! On a happy note, I can say that my wife reached a settlement agreement with her employer. We were both left stunned at the sizeable agreement we reached. We believe that if it wasn’t for all of Sam’s hard work this would never have happened. This testimonial has taken me a month to write after finally coming to terms that this whole horrible situation is finally over after nearly two years. It had taken over our lives and I can’t explain the impact it caused to all of the family, but the best and main thing is I can already see my wife’s health improving. We can’t thank Sam enough for all of his help and hard work and will always be in his debt. What can I say, if it wasn’t for Sam we wouldn’t be where we are today and that’s the truth. Trust and listen to Sam and there’ll be only one winner. As always Sam, thanks for everything. S & D

You were there when I needed help!
You listen to what I had to say;
You were very honest about the cost;
You advice was paramount;
You cared when I went in hospital you sent me a text on the day;
You replied to my emails;
You help me though a journey I didn’t think I could do;
You were there at end of phone on many occasions;
You know employment law  100%;
You cared ……… (Most important ) out of everything !
You were my Angel Sam.

I kid you not – this man is a firecracker in the best possible way!  I was facing trumped up charges so that management could render me untrustworthy and therefore unemployable.  I knew what I had said and done in my everyday workplace and found it almost insurmountable to get my own version of events on the table.  My health steadily went down – I lost so much weight that I became borderline diabetic.  My line manager continued her weekly meetings with me, drawing me deeper into her web of deceit and lies which I had to argue against.  At that point I believed there was no way out.  My wonderful and supporting husband found Sam’s website – in desperation at my dire circumstances as I was inconsolable and grief stricken at the treatment I was receiving from such a strong, social care organisation, for whom I had such a high trust and pride in.  I must admit that I did not hold any hope when downloading templates from the website, but when I read what I had downloaded, there was just  a glimmer of well, let’s try this.   Fast forward to many chats with Sam (who was always available at the end of a phone, no matter where he was or what he was doing) and constant communication with the next move, letters to management, what to expect etc.  He was on the money every time, he predicted how management would react and I learned to not only follow his lead, but trust his lead.  The outcome was more than satisfactory – the very Chair of my Disciplinary ensured that I was employed within his Directorate and ironically, I now work within law.  It’s taken me at least 18 months to write this, as it was such an horrendous experience and well, I just had to put down in words how awesome, thoroughly awesome, Sam Stone is.  God bless the man, indeed!

I am writing this testimonial in response to the help I have received from Sam.  I never thought I would feel strongly enough to write one for any person, but feel compelled to do so, for this man.  I am not lying, when I state I would have taken my own life had I not come into contact with Sam through his website.  I know it might sound as an exaggeration, but this man has saved my life.  He has been there for me when I had no one to turn to.  Before speaking with Sam, I had spent thousands of pounds obtaining advice from both a solicitor and barrister, and to be honest, in my opinion, it was money wasted.  I cannot state how reasonable Sam’s fees are, when I compare to fees I paid the so-called professionals.   When I received advice from Sam, it was amazing, he made connections and links that so called professional parasites overlooked, and he guided me through each step writing my grievance and appeal letters (and so much more).  I was amazed by Sam’s immense knowledge of the law and his ability to quote statues and authorities from memory.  Sam wrote such amazing letters that my employers’ HR and its legal department finally stood up and took notice of me.   In my opinion Sam’s knowledge and letter writing skills are comparable to that, if not better that a Queen Counsellor.  My success in taking on my employers is all down to Sam; and I will never be able to repay him for giving me back my life.  Sam – thank you sincerely form the bottom of my heart for everything you have done for me.

I found Sams website by chance when I was looking for help with a work problem.I am not in a union,found the solicitors I spoke to only interested in how much I could pay them,was not getting any answers from the manager concerned or from the HR department….in short lost and very confused. Sam knew what questions to ask and just how to put them in terms that would be understood.The letter he helped me to write to the HR department must have worked as I had a telephone call from the Director immediately (this after months of being ignored) and the issues where dealt with straight away.Sam provided me with impartial advice that helped me to look at the problem in a different way as when you are confused and being treated badly it can be difficult to know what to do.Thank you for talking to me Sam, I appreciate your help very,very much.

Dear Sam, I just wanted to drop you a line to thank you for your invaluable help with my recent difficulties with my employer. When browsing the internet looking for advice on writing a grievance letter I came across your website. Having read through some of the reviews I decided I had nothing to lose by giving you a call. I am so glad I did, right from the start you seemed to understand exactly what I was going through you gave me sensible and practical advice. I decided there and then to have you write my grievance letter for me and what a letter it was. I wish I could have been there when the directors read it! Your letter changed everything and from then on your were my life line. The speed of your responses and your expertise was outstanding. There were times when I felt like giving up because of the stress but one call to you reassured me that I had a good case because my employers had behaved appallingly. Every time I called you it was like talking to an old friend and as the situation progressed you provided outstanding responses to my employers letters to the point where you had them running for cover. On Friday as you know we agreed a substantial out of court settlement which was entirely down to you. No solicitor would have given my case the level of attention you did or given me the emotional support. Your charges are so reasonable and your knowledge of Employment and Equality Law is awesome. I know that I wouldn’t be where I am now without you. I would happily recommend your services to anyone going through a similar situation as myself. Sincere thanks and very best wishes for the future. A very happy client

I found Sam Stone to be brilliant in every sense of the word.  When I found Sam, I was struggling in a very difficult situation at work involving long term bullying and harassment.  I wanted to submit a Grievance but had little idea of how to go about it as the issues were complex.  From the first Sam was supportive, clear, ‘straight-down-the line’, and, of course, extremely knowledgeable about the various statutes and processes involved. He was able to reduce what seemed to me to be be a hopelessly complicated case into a very straight-forward, but nonetheless powerful,submission to my organisation.  Both the Grievance and Grievance Hearing Templates laid the foundation for my submission/s and then Sam suggested some ‘tweaks’ to assist in finalising them.  He always got back to me quickly when I emailed or phoned and mentored me through the whole grievance process with an empathic but no fuss approach.  His fees are extremely reasonable (I don’t know how he does what he does for the price!) and he is transparent about these. My case turned out very well indeed and this was in very large part due to Sam’s assistance.  Sam was my guardian angel throughout a terrible ordeal and I can’t thank him enough.

I came across Sam Sone when I was looking for help to write a grievance letter. I was in a pretty desperate state of mind. Suffering from work related stress and anxiety which in turn had aggravated my stress related medical condition. I agonised about contacting Sam and the decision to trust a stranger, especially as at this point as I had not only been let down by my employer but my union were a complete waste of time. I cannot express how glad I was that I decided to email Sam and ask for advice regarding a grievance letter. Sam asked me to call him and from that moment on I didn’t feel alone or afraid anymore, I had someone on my side who astounded me with his wealth of knowledge and understanding. He understood everything I told him instantly. His expertise in employment law was incredible. I decided to enlist Sam to draft my grievance letter and at last I felt like my employer had to sit up and listen and believe me they did. Sam told me everything that would happen, he told me how my employer would try to whitewash my grievance and he also told me how we would fight back with a grievance appeal.  It has been 7 months of probably the most stressful time I have ever been through but at last I have reached a compromise agreement without going to the ET. I can at last move forward with my life, I cannot believe how relieved and happy I feel that with Sam on my side I stood firm against a massive employer who had no intention of taking responsibility for their actions, who tried to make me submissive and take away my dignity.  I can only say if you are as desperate as I was, trust your instincts, Sam was everything the testimonials claim he is. You have to trust him he knows what he is talking about. Sam goes above and beyond what you expect, his understanding, empathy and reassurance is priceless. Yes it is his business, he has to make a living but you cannot put into words how Sam goes the extra mile. I felt like I not only had someone in my corner who was going to put up a ferocious fight but a friend who helped me keep everything in perspective.  I have learnt some valuable lessons from Sam, never again would I let anyone treat me how my employer treated me. I have just reached an agreement for an amount that I am happy with but more than anything I have my self respect back and that is priceless.  Thank you Sam.

I found Sam’s website when researching the grievance procedure, having been through many months of hell at work.  I rang Sam to get an idea of the service he offered and was surprised that he spent well over an hour talking it through with me.  I paid him to write my formal letter of grievance – and what a letter!  He picked things up that I would have certainly overlooked, as he is extremely astute in terms of employment law/health and safety, so was able to elaborate those elements and put much more weight behind them.  I was ready to resign on more than one occasion, but Sam encouraged me to hang in there and was with me every step of the way, until finally after 4 months my company offered me a settlement agreement, the outcome being very satisfactory.  I’m so glad it’s over now, and will be forever grateful to Sam for his guidance (and to his lovely wife Amy!).

When I read the testimonials on Sam’s website, I thought it was too good to be true; however, I was being bullied and harassed at work by my line manager. The situation was totally out of control and I was suffering from severe anxiety as I tried to deal with this and understand my employment rights. I called Sam and he called me straight back.  From that point on Sam Stone was incredible. He understood the issues immediately and helped me with my grievance letter and was there to advise me through a very difficult period.  Sometimes the organisation you work for stack the odds against you: Sam Stone levelled the odds. I am extremely grateful to the service he provides.

I found Sam’s page by accident whilst researching how to write a Grievance Letter, my wife was being subjected to the most disgusting behavior by an employer imaginable, the treatment was so bad that my wife suffered a mental breakdown. I emailed Sam and soon afterwards we were discussing the wrongdoings on the telephone, that was the best thing I ever did. Sam’s advice was uplifting, his outlook was positive and his approach to the matter in hand was to go after the bastards and give them a bloody nose. We spent the next couple of months communicating by phone and email, it was always a pleasure to talk with Sam, his knowledge in this field is immense. With Sam in your corner you have more than a fighting chance of beating the employer.
Needless to say, my wife was paid in an out of court settlement. Had she been stronger we would have taken the case all the way through. If your reading this then you have found the right site for righting an employment wrong, Sam has perseverance and tenacity, backed with a knowledge and experience and an unprecedented spirit in supporting the under dog. If you are still in any doubt if Sam is your man and you don’t contact him, you have already lost your case.

Sam was amazing! He reviewed my grievance letter over night and responded by the following day. The transformation was astonishing. My employers did not know what hit them. They of course played their games and this became clear when I inadvertently got hold of their legal bill and read the type of work their lawyers were doing on my grievance. It was clear they were doing what they had to. Throughout the grievance process I felt Sam’s letter applied a lot of pressure on my employers. To bail themselves out they offered £25k as a settlement. Sam without you this would not have been possible! Thanks again! A. Ali.

I found Sam by chance at the beginning of January 2014 when I was searching the internet for a formal grievance template.  Sam was absolutely the best thing that could have happened to me and thank God I found him!  The solicitor I had originally contacted had no interest in taking on my case and, even worse, was quite scathing.  When you are facing an uphill (or more realistically an up-mountain) struggle against an employer who has treated you badly, as well as trying to find your way through the grievance procedure, then Sam is without doubt your man.  Not only has he got a wealth of legal knowledge but he can also empathise with what you are going through.  He is readily available and provides excellent advice and support.  His letters are incredible – I so wish I had been there to see the look on my employer’s face when they saw my grievance letter!  Thankfully we were able to settle without going to Court and for a healthy sum of money too. Thank you so much, Sam, and I can only endorse what someone has already written about you in their testimonial – you are truly God sent.   Chantal.

‘I contacted Sam by email and he called me later the same day. He had read the letter I had sent him and provided expert knowledge and insight into what I needed to improve. He was very clear about the cost from the beginning, and it was more than reasonable. He sent me my reworded letter less than 24 hours after receiving it, and gave me advice as to what timelines I needed to consider when submitting it. The grievance letter was brilliant and contained specific reference to all of the relevant legislation and standards, he obviously has expert knowledge. I feel much more confident now I have this to send to my employer! Thank you for all your hard work!’ Vicki – Leeds

Tired, helpless, drained, confused and facing an impossible situation with my employer – yes that was me in January 2014 when I found myself in the midst of an employment situation at work. I was suspended for raising a grievance against few people in senior management. Yes that’s true, instead of listening to my verbal grievance HR gave its verdict very quickly – I was wrong and subsequently started a campaign to drive me out of my employment even in the face of clear and undisputed evidence. I was myself in a management position, colleagues who previously sided with me and the truth, very quickly backed off under pressure. I was facing my employment situation with an organisation that was extremely powerful and had a national and international presence. Employment solicitor I hired in hurry was only concerned with money and demanded money at every phone call I made for advise. Enter
www.formalgrievance.com
I was in urgent need searching desperately for help in writing a grievance letter to my employer, by this time I have lost all my faith in the solicitor who was acting on my behalf. I was already hurting due the lies and the false case that was suddenly erected against me. Please allow me to say this that I am a physically fit well built man and I feel no shame in admitting that I was now weak – physically and mentally. People who read this will know how such an employment situation really feels like – you face it alone – the power of your employer on one side and you on the other side.
I 1000% believe God answered my prayer- I found Sam Stone’s
www.formalgrievance.com
whilst searching for help on the internet. But my situation was like Red sea, if I go back I face the terrible consequences, If I go forward I drown in the Red sea. By this time my employer was already using pressure for me to relinquish and just accept their deal – to take back my grievance and accept their deal which included a quite resignation. I agree with Elizabeth’s testimonial on Sam’s website, that Sam not only advises you “he goes for the kill”.
Sam was my “Legal Angel” very quickly he understood my situation whereby it took me hours to explain to my solicitor what Sam understood in literally half an hour on the phone. He drafted a grievance and whistleblowing letter quoting relevant laws with every point he made and then he laughed confidently at the other end of the phone saying “just forward what I sent you to your employer”. I wish I was in the room when HR managers were reading Sam’s letter, or even better when my Boss was reading it. One can just imagine what they said…. Sam was methodical and his knowledge surpasses even the best employment solicitor. The immediate result was that my employer’s reply tone changed – much more sympathetic and forthcoming. I couldn’t believe this was just one letter Sam wrote. As the time went on and the battle became ferocious my employer used every trick in the book to get out of compensating me, and I mean every trick. However with Sam on my side and his arsenal of sound TACTICAL advice and his letters to my employer cut through this impossible situation and my employer finally agreed to negotiate out of court settlement. Let me say this to all who will at some point in their employment read this – I categorically believe that Sam was Godsend, Sam was divine help sent to me as an answer to my prayer in terrible circumstances.
Sam is an Angel who just happens to have wealth of legal knowledge and not only that he has the ability to write powerful, systematic coherent letters and above all Sam takes personal interest to see that “no body wrongs you”. Sam personal approach to me was a breath of fresh air – which no solicitor or a barrister can ever give me. Sam’s absolute commitment to my cause resulted in my employer finally backing off and agreed to resolve the situation very quickly. I won an all rounded settlement agreement. It is very difficult to describe fully what Sam has done for me. He is a friend who will always be in my prayers as his help was timely and amazing. It really is awesome in the way he applied his legal knowledge to my situation and helped me. Thank you so very much Sam, thank you thousand times. All my friends have noted his website and I recommend him whenever people ask me regarding my employment situation. You think your employment situation is impossible and you don’t know which way to turn-  just think again and contact Sam Stone – well try and see for yourself, you will find out very soon that every praise on this website (mine included) is true by every word. I  whole heartedly agree with people who have written testimonials on Sam’s website suggesting that he should be knighted for all his endeavours to the downtrodden – to help those for whom their doesn’t seem to be help out there in the maze of employment law.

Before we discovered Sam’s website we were about at the end of our tether and about to concede to the torts of my husband’s unscrupulous employer. In such a short space of time since contacting Sam, he has given us the encouragement, instruction and guidance to completely turn tables on the employer and now they are on the receiving end. Believe me, any employer will get more than they have ever bargained for.  It is the fastest service we have ever had, and we really feel taken care of.  What we have appreciated about using Sam’s services is not only his tenacity and wealth of knowledge, he truly delivers what he promises and so much more in understanding and compassion too. We can say with confidence that we believe that anyone who chooses to contact Sam will have an equally positive experience. Our very grateful thanks Jane & Scott.

If you are reading this it is probably because you are facing an employment crisis. I was in your situation six months ago and it was truly one of the darkest times in my life. Sam Stone was a beacon. I can only say that if you are willing to put your trust in Sam from the start, I believe he can and will help you reach safety. For me, the experience has been kind of like having a big brother around when you’ve been bullied in the school yard, but in my case every ‘punch’ packed a point of law that Sam fully understood would get my employers to back down. I really wish I could have been in the room when those ********* (I think anyone reading this has his/her own adjective for their respective employers) read the grievance letter! Everyone – from the Citizens Advice Bureau to a highly recommended Employment Solicitor who read through Sam Stone’s grievance letter he custom drafted for me stated that it was, unequivocally, Teflon. And it was. I’m now safely out of a situation that frankly could have wrecked my career.  A few other things you need to know: it was necessary for me to seek additional consultation from Sam because my employers kept kicking out right to the very end. If you find yourself in a similar situation, keep going. Trust the process. Sam is extremely good at gauging a situation. He estimated my employers would drop by March 2014 and they did. I’m glad that Sam remained engaged in the work to the end, e.g. letters and discussion, not least because his confidence that I would be alright and his sense of humour really helped me get a grip. I genuinely doubt you would get support like this from anyone else who does this for a living. The other thing to know about Sam is this: while I appreciate he is doing this for a living, I also believe he does this because he is a warrior ‘for justice’. Thank you, Sam. Fight on!

Sam, I had initially submitted my first grievance on the 18th of December 2013 and my employer had ignored it. You did an updated version  for me, and because of your help things seem to be moving. I know it’s not over yet but since you involvement, the company now treats me with a bit more respect and that’s all down to your help with the grievance letter. When l first saw testimony’s on your wall l thought people where exaggerating but you are truly God sent. I am grateful and l know its the beginning but your involvement has certainly made a massive difference already. Thank thank so much. Look forward to working with you once HR sends the written investigation.
Thank you

First of all, I secretly believe Sam is a retired employment Barrister  who has decided to help the regular person. Sam lives and breathes employment law. He is quite extraordinary; in my situation he has consistently empathised with me. I am confident he can do the same for you. If you’re anything like me, I recommend that you:
• stop dreaming or hoping that one day your employer will decide to say  “sorry” and treat you correctly
• bypass any half-hearted union representation (if that’s your  experience ), and get Sam on the case
In my opinion Sam serves individuals who do not have money to burn, that are experiencing a significant employment injustice/conflict. Quite simply, Sam has been a huge stabilising force during my employment  crisis. Both my family and I have suffered immensely over the last year.  I have literally spoken with Sam every week since the middle of 2013. At times we have spoken every day. There is no lawyer or union  representative who is going to offer you that level of service. His energy levels are quite astounding. Sam will get serious about your grievance without you spending tens of thousands. In my case the settlement he helped us achieve has enabled my family to pay off debts and start over. Clearly, all cases are different however; if you have not got tens of thousands to burn there is no question in my mind that Sam Stone is your best hope. I don’t do hero worship, but this man has certainly earned my utmost respect. Thank you Sam and Amy, I hope to stay in touch.

Hi Sam, I would like to say a big thank you for all your help and support since I started my Grievance back in the month of March.  All the paperwork you have drafted and done was really good.  It was a very long and stressful 9 months before everything got sorted by a Compromise Agreement, but I don’t think I would have made it without your help.

I found Sam’s site by accident when researching how best to write a formal grievance letter, and I am so glad that I did. As well as being extremely knowledgeable, Sam was also able to provide me with much needed support and encouragement. With Sam’s help and expert guidance, I was able to secure a significant payout from the WORST company I have ever worked for.

After reading Sam’s testimonials we contacted Sam to help us with a very difficult work situation that was going on for a number of years. To cut a long story short, my employers had ignored, and to be quite frank, totally rode roughshod over my lifelong debilitating bowl disease. That’s when we contacted Sam. I’d filed my grievance to my employers, and as anyone who’s been in our situation is aware, it was totally whitewashed. My employer had put not only myself through hell, but also my partner as well-we had suffered. We can’t begin to put into words our appreciation, but when Sam took us under his wing, that’s when things really started to change. Now Sam knows his stuff, believe me! Sam was there to block every move my employers tried to make, and believe me, they tried every dirty trick in the book!!  To us, quite honestly, Sam has been our rock, without his unrelenting support and guidance we would of just given up because of my illness. I know Sam is not a solicitor, but when it comes to employment law/rights, Sam really knows his stuff. There were so many times I was ill and ever so depressed and wanted to quit, but Sam was always there to support us and guide us through the whole daunting process. My employer settled out of court for a very sizeable amount!  Myself and my partner would strongly advise anyone reading this who’s been treated badly by there employer to contact Sam ASAP as this man not only cares about his clients, but also he cares about people, we owe you so much Sam, we will never forget what you’ve done for us, you are a real genuine lovely guy. There’s not of people who go out there way to help people like us, day and night, even weekends….he’s always there. God bless you Sam – Peter and Sian.

Disability Discrimination is an issue that Sam not only understood fully from a legal standpoint but also understood fully how the harassment and discrimination makes you feel. My experience was sadly not uncommon but Sam understood my employment experience and issues on a level as if he had lived it with me. It is without hesitation I recommend the Formal Grievance service as being the authority in dealing with poor employers, vicious solicitors and HR personnel. Employer’s who believe they can exploit their position to use, mock, degrade or bully you are about to be served what I can only describe as something they will NEVER forget when you enlist Sam on your team. I saw my employer transform from a confident bully into a quivering wreck by the time Sam and I had finished. The feeling of achievement is overwhelming.

If you’re reading this page you might find the praise quite  extraordinary and rather unbelievable.
Well, I can honestly say I have found it to be all true. Frankly, you  purchase much more than templates and a carefully constructed grievance / appeal documents. You’re buying a high level employment law strategist and legal thinker.  Sam consistently under promises and over performs. His content is  fearless, bruising, but extremely effective. I can’t recommend Sam highly enough. However, I must say to any  potential customer you will need buy into Sam’s guidance. Employers can  become remarkably contemptuous. And, if this is your first time in conflict of this nature you will struggle to survive without Sam’s in-depth support. Please do not be fooled into believing you can do this  work yourself. This is not guess work. Sam delivers a well-honed  response all of the time. Put short, if you can’t afford it, save; and if he is not available, wait.  It will be worth it.

I cannot thank you enough for the help and support you have given me over the last 18 months. I discovered your website at one of the most difficult times in my life and you helped me see the wood for the trees. Your website is undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the Internet and you are clearly passionate about helping others. Without your help and support I would not have been able to challenge the army of HR staff that were determined to prevent me from properly airing my grievance. Most of all though, you have always been available, whenever I’ve needed to speak to someone and you helped me to remain confident with my convictions. Thanks to your help I managed to settle out of court and two months later I feel a different person. My solicitor said I had already done most of the legwork but it was you that did this for me, with your extensive resources, knowledge and an obvious passion for helping people in difficulty.
The very best regards

Where do I begin! Sam you are a true hero. I had never been in the position where I needed to seek help on my employment situation.  I first contacted Sam way back in 2012 and from that moment on you have been my life line. Always available, very supportive and your knowledge is endless. Over the past two years my life and work has been turned upside down. My union were terrible to say the least, not interested or worth me bothering with. You came on board with your support and you were amazing. I could not ever of been able to have managed these two years without the endless support you have given. I completely trusted you and the things you said.   After two long years of running back and forth to you for help and support and letter writing,  I finally saw my time in the Employment Tribunal Court in Birmingham, where after representing myself I won my case and was awarded compensation. May I just say I am so pleased that I had this opportunity to have you on my side to help me with the grievance and disciplinary procedures, which I faced. The grievance letter you wrote for me was fantastic. It was used through the whole trial at the Tribunal. Without those letters and your constant support things could be so different. You are cheaper by far and so much better than any legal person that I have come into contact with. I truly cannot express my sincere thanks to you Sam.

I found myself in an unfortunate position  whereby I had to raise a grievance against my employer. Working with Sam for 3.5 months, resulted in compensation that I would never have got had I done this on my own, or indeed through a UK lawyer in my opinion. I managed to reach a compensation agreement 3 times more than my solicitor told me I would, with Sam’s help. I cannot recommend Sam highly enough. His  in-dept knowledge of UK Employment law, his approach, guidance and support is exactly what you need to take on your employer. To finish up my testimonial, a grievance case is a very tough process to go through.  Prepare yourself to be challenged by how nasty employers can get when you raise a grievance. Not to worry though as working with Sam will mean you can achieve the results I did. Go get em with Sam at your side!

Having a disability and having to manoeuvre a minefield of Equality and Disability Law, I took on Sam’s help and have never looked back since. I went the extra step and had Sam write my Grievance Letter and Grievance Appeal. My company duly settled out of court for a substantial sum. The only time it took was to get together the facts for Sam and let him work his magic! Throughout the process as you get correspondence from your employer it can get very confusing but Sam was only a call/email away to assure me that its not a problem and what they were trying to do. I would recommend Sam to anyone having an issue at work and needs help to resolve it.

What can I say?  From September onwards I was in a very bad place, trying to keep it all together following my Father’s death and dealing with my employers who were using every trick in the book to bring me down.  Then I came across Sam’s website and the clouds started to lift.  First I downloaded the letter template, which was the start of the road towards justice.  My employers, as suspected, carried on with their antics, trying to ignore what I was doing and no doubt hoping that I would just go away.  Sam has been there at every turn, advising me and telling me not to give up hope as they will tie themselves in knots to my advantage.  His knowledge and expertise is second to none.  I had consulted solicitors who advised me that my case was not strong enough.   I cannot speak highly enough of him and would recommend him to anyone.   THANK YOU SAM

I feel compelled to write about Sam Stone.  He is a man that you can rely on.  I found his website by chance and contemplated whether or not to contact him.  I told my husband about the site and asked what he thought.  We agreed I had nothing to lose.  My employer had been acting as judge, jury and executioner and I was now off sick with work related stress developing into severe anxiety, panic disorder, social disorder and depression.  Don’t get me wrong I’m a stoic lady but I had been worn down by my unscrupulous employers whom I had worked for 13years.  My husband called Sam and spoke to him for over an hour.  I had already been through the disciplinary and appeal processes and did not know where to turn next.  Sam Stone is the equalizer as far as I am concerned.  I no longer feel I am being battered down by my unscrupulous employers, Sam Stone equalled the fight.  As I had little time left before the 3 month minus 1 day rule lapsed Sam drew up a grievance letter for me that I can honestly say was my ‘Rocky’ moment.  I was able to deliver a blow worthy of any contender.  He answers any queries my husband or I might have and although we are not at the end of the process I know that with Sam’s knowledge, skills and help I will obtain some form of justice.  He is selfless in his ability to champion and encourage employees like me who have been beaten down by unscrupulous employers’ tactics.  Sam’s fees are reasonable and that has enabled me to fight my corner.  Without Sam Stone I would not be in the position I am in today.  Don’t feel dejected, beaten down and out.  Pick up the phone or e-mail Sam Stone, he is the man that can help.  I have no doubt that with Sam’s help I will get a result that favours me and not my employers.

Dear Sam
Thank you Sam from the bottom of my heart!  I do not know how I would have coped throughout my ordeal without your professional expertise, guidance and support.  You were there for me every step of the way in the grievance procedure.  God bless you and all you hold dear.

Hi Sam
Just a quick message to say that I have found you supportive and helpful with regard to discussing my employment issues. As an HR professional myself, I still found your templates extremely useful as they get straight to the point with great reference to employment law. It is very easy when writing a grievance letter to ramble or be led by emotion. Your template ensures the argument is put forward in a concise and direct way.   I also think it was extremely good of you to spend time speaking to me at short notice. I wish you and you website the very best as it is a great alternative to going to a solicitor , which can cost an extortionate amount.
Thanks Dave

I was about to attempt the task of writing a grievance letter and didn’t know where to start! I came across Sam’s Website of formal grievance.com and read the information on the website, it explained you should make sure you include the law into your letter. After reading this I spoke to Sam and from our conversation trusted my instincts to hire Sam to help me in writing my grievance letter. A decision that was the best I made! I would never have got the result I got without using Sam. I thank Sam for his work and if I ever go through this in future, he would be the first person I would want to help me. Anybody thinking about calling upon Sam for his services, don’t delay just do it! You won’t regret that decision.

Sam was an absolute Godsend to me. From the moment I read his online grievance letter and other testimonials, I knew I had to get in touch with him and I am so glad I did. I felt I was at the end of the road and I was about to walk away from my job after months of discrimination and harassment which had led to my ill health physically and mentally. I had lost all my confidence and thought everybody was against me but Sam was one person who understood what I was going through. I was able to rely on him for good guidance and guidance which helped get me through the huddles of dealing with my grievance. His knowledge of the law far exceeds any lawyer I have dealt with.  I am now very well informed of my rights as an employee and I no longer have to be a victim again. I am spreading the good news that Sam is the man for anybody who needs help with submitting a grievance due to discrimination, bullying, harassment or similar issues at work! Thank you, thank you and God bless you Sam. I cannot thank you enough!

If James Bond had a grievance letter among his many gadgets, it would have been written by Sam Stone. I absolutely love this guy to bits. He has helped me and many of my friends who would have been victims of workplace injustice. Solicitors go for the easy win and easy money. Sam goes for the kill. I developed diabetes in my previous job due to my unsupported hidden disabilities however I managed to reverse it after strict dieting and hard exercise. I soon started a new job and the company did not make reasonable adjustment for my impairments. This resulted in me devolving high blood pressure and the diabetes came back. I searched for help by contacting the usual public bodies who turned out to be as useful as a glass hammer. I was depressed and in a state of panic with no hope of survival. I contacted Sam and he wrote me a Grievance/Whistleblowing letter. To say that this letter was impressive would be an understatement. The letter was a cross between death by a thousand cuts and the bamboo method. When the director read it, he must have felt like it was a shard of glass going through his eye……very slowly.  Sam helped me out through all stages of the process. Because of my impairments, I needed a bit of emotional support and confidence. Sam spoke to me and helped me get my head straight before the encounters with HR and I will always be grateful to him for this. Things got resolved at work very quickly thanks to Sam. With Sam on my side I am now confident in taking on any nasty bullying employers because I know I will come out on top. Forget the unions; forget the public bodies and mediation, if you want to win, use Sam’s letters. P.S. Sam should be knighted for his services to the downtrodden. P.P.S. All people out there with dyslexia or any other neuro-diverse condition should defiantly use his letter because you are at a higher risk of detrimental treatment at the hands of the employer. It is not just a grievance letter, but some sort of insurance against further ill treatment. Elizabeth x

I had been bullied by two managers at work for a sustained period of time, and my health was beginning to suffer. The more time I missed at work, the more my managers harassed me. It was a vicious circle and I saw no way of breaking it other than walking away. Luckily I found Sam’s website, and from that moment things only improved. From the first time I spoke to Sam, I knew that I was speaking to somebody who actually cared and who had the knowledge and experience to help me right the wrongs that were being done. Sam helped me write my grievance letter and it was quite obvious from my employer’s response that we had already started to tie them in knots. Sam was at hand to draft eloquent and powerful responses to my employer. Sam was always at the end of the phone, and when things got tough….and they will, Sam was reassuring. I also know that Sam would have told me to walk away if he thought my case wasn’t strong enough. Sam needs to make a living, but money isn’t everything to him. Sam’s knowledge of the law, his ability to write powerful and coherent letters and his determination to see that justice was served meant that my employer offered to resolve the matter before it went to court. If any of this sounds familiar, get in touch with Sam. You won’t regret it.

Sam has been an absolute Godsend for me. I was in such a bad mental state through my employers not dealing with my bullying line manager and his being backed-up by his manager. I was suspended and signed off sick. My employers were intent of sacking me as my “face no longer fit”. I had all but given up and had resigned myself to being given the boot, as I didn’t understand the game my employers were playing.  After spending a huge amount of money on a London solicitor who expressed little interest in my case, I was at my lowest ebb. My girlfriend found Sam’s website and we never once looked back after that. Sam was a pillar of strength, offering excellent guidance and encouragement all along. He was so inspiring and his knowledge of employment law is outstanding. I can say that without Sam to help steady the boat, my relationship may well have ended due to the huge stress and anxiety involved. In fact my girlfriend is still using Sam’s services now in a dispute with her employers. We feel very secure that Sam is giving us the correct guidance and he goes above and beyond in being there to guide us through the process. I have recommended Sam to any friends who have mentioned difficulties at work. I would no hesitate to call him immediately if you find yourself in trouble with your employers.My case is now settled and I am very happy with the result. I have moved on to rebuild my life and my relationship and am now pursuing my real passion in life. Thank you Sam.  Cheers buddy

What can i say about Sam. It’s very difficult to put into words what Sam has done for me the last few months or so. My problems with my employer finally seem to be coming to an end and Sam has been there for me and my family all the way. When things were really getting to me emotionally and pyschologically he was there to pick me up, lift my spirits and push me along. All the time he was positive and re-assured me time and time again not to give in and that my employer will settle. And he was right. My employer were using every cheap trick in the book to cause me endless problems and threats so to scare me in order that i drop my claim. Sam was way to smart for them and had answers to everything they could throw our way. Got to be honest I nearly chucked the towel in a few times but Sam was there for me. Although I have never met Sam I can honestly say that I now see him as a good friend who I will forever be greatful. Put simply if it was not for Sam I would never have got through my ordeal. Lesson for everyone who is currently working with Sam on their respective cases please please please listen to exactly what Sam says and trust him explicitly  and whatever you do DON’T give up. It will be tough at times, trust me, but have faith and belief in Sam Stone. His knowledge and passion for employment law is unbelievable and he is worth  every penny. He sees things in the grievance procedure which are unreal and words responses in such a manner that makes the employer and their solicitor look silly. God bless you mate – L**

Hi Sam, firstly let me take this opportunity in thanking you for you for assisting me in obtaining a satisfactory compromise in the persuance of my employer. Your guidance and expertise were excellent, you were always available to talk at short notice and your response time for corrsspendence was excellent. My employer has now finalised the compromise agreement and paid the money as agreed. I can now put this horrendous experience behind me; something I don’t think would have been possible without your help. If any of my friends or family ever finds in a similiar sifuation I would have no hesitation in recommending your services. Again thank you for your help. I hope that i can now put this bad experience behind me and enjoy the rest of my life. Kind regards J** – Wiltshire

After my being involved in 2 road accidents in less than 5 months whilst working, I also saw another motorist killed in front of me. My friends and family realised I had considerable problems. I didn’t! My manager was aware of my problems and piled on the pressure. Setting ever more targets and criticising my performance at every opportunity, he began my employer’s disciplinary procedure. As complainant, judge and jury, he issued a ‘Final Written Warning’ within 12 weeks on the day before I visited the doctor. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and work related stress. The doctor gave me a ‘fit note’ for 2 weeks in August 2012 and this has been extended to end of January 2013. I had thought about resigning to end the hassle. In November 2012, the company wrongly put me on SSP. A solicitor specialising in employment law who demanded pre payment for 4 hours of her time, to read my documents. Any extra work would cost £178.00 per hour in advance. I decided to write a ‘Letter of Grievance’ myself and used Google to find some guidance. Sam’s website was 1st on the search results and offered a grievance template letter for £12 which I bought. I talked to Sam and it was instantly obvious he knew how to handle the process. Preliminary letters and a specific ‘Letter of Grievance’ were drafted by Sam. These documents were submitted just before Xmas 2012. The company suddenly agreed to use the ACAS conciliation service. It took 3 weeks for an agreement to be reached. A substantial agreed sum has been paid to terminate my employment and I can now get on with my life. This would not have been possible without Sam’s expertise. I recommend anyone with an employment law problem to use him. R****** from Manchester.

I first contacted Sam in October 2012. I found myself in a difficult position with my employer that I could not have ever dreamt possible after all of my hard work and commitment. During a 10 month period I had suffered two pregnancy losses and was informed that IVF treatment was my only option to start a much wanted family. Following my return to work after my second absence I was subjected to a series of discrimination acts and harassment by my direct manager. I was a senior manager myself and although I knew what was happening was wrong I wasn’t able to see it in relation to employment law in the way Sam did when we spoke. I was signed off as unfit to work by my doctor following 10 weeks of this discrimination. Sam talked me through what he saw in my case, what I liked about Sam was his direct approach, he was matter of fact and realistic with me at every step. I helped Sam with collating the facts in my own words and then he wrote my grievance letter. He also wrote my appeal letter to their response. I was made 3 offers by my employer, the final one amounted to a year’s salary and this offer was made within 1 week of them receiving my appeal letter. It is difficult to put in to words the help and support Sam gave me during this time, he was always available via e-mail and would consult with me before I spoke with my employer. There is no doubt at all that Sam was the fundamental reason I have now settled my case and can move on from this awful experience. I learnt a lot from Sam and have no regrets whatsoever in using his skills and experience. All the very best and thanks once again for a brilliant result, I couldn’t have done without you. Jane
Sam, what people have written on your testimonials page is right. I learnt more from you in 20 minutes on the phone than the solicitors I paid for guidance.
Adam
Dear Sam – We have just resolved my wife’s employment issue which has finally had a reasonable outcome. I have to say that it was the excellent guidance you provided, and in particular the grievance template which provided the basis for the positive end result. I would like to thank you on behalf of us both for your excellent guidance. I have no hesitation in recommending your services to anyone experiencing employment problems. Best wishes – C****
This year Sam came to my rescue and saved my day. He is a very approachable, kind and compassionate man. Which is exactly what you need if you find yourself bullied by a corporate giant! A couple of years ago, I went through a nasty non-work related trauma which led to me suffering a bout of PTSD and severe depression (my employer was aware). I thought I had recovered but when my employer used my personal life (my trauma) against me, I found myself suffering a re-occurrence of both illnesses. After my employer refused to make any allowances to separate my ‘harraser’ and I, I searched the internet for help and found Sam. He immediately told me that I had suffered discrimination and I was covered by the Disability Act (no one else I had spoken to, including ACAS, saw the link between the 2 events). He wrote my 13 page grievance letter. Well done to Sam for another case solved before court! Thank you so much for your help this year – you are a true gentleman!
Denise, London.
Sam’s guidance and support has been invaluable to me during an extremely difficult time. His knowledge has been vital in correspondence with my employer over the last few months and has given me the confidence to take my employer to tribunal. Sam has worked extremely hard on my grievance and knowing he is always there for guidance is very comforting. I would urge anyone who is having difficulties with their employer to contact Sam, he is extremely personable and with his help you can fight your employer and win!

‘I contacted Sam in June 2012 after deciding i wanted to take action against my employer. I briefly explained my situation on email to Sam who responded very quickly and suggested i bought his template aid for writing a grievance. I did so and Sam then looked over it for me before i sent it off. From there on in Sam helped me through the whole process, whether it be responding to letters or just giving me advise all the time. Sam was always available and extremely reliable. I was unsure about paying somebody upfront for letters to be done but i put my trust in Sam who assured me it would be OK and it was, on several occasions. My issue is still on going and i am still in contact with Sam for guidance. I can honestly say i would not have been able to get to this stage without his guidance. I truly do appreciate it and would recommend him anytime.’
I was totally stuck in dealing with a serial bully who was essentially stopping me from doing my job and preventing me from implementing my duty of care to other staff. Sam helped me see the wood for the trees, and guided me through the procedural stuff and legal case law resulting in me raising a formal grievance. I’ve wanted to back out on many an occasions but he’s been there all the way keeping me strong and helping me stand up for what is right and honourable. Thanks Sam an invaluable service. Anonymous.
I recently found myself in a situation where I had to make a formal grievance against my employer. I was recommended to use Sam by a friend and I was incredibly impressed by his expertise, support and tenacity. He helped me to understand the process and support me through the times I wobbled as this can be an unpleasant process. With Sam’s help I secured a payment from my ex employee and was able to walk away with my head held high. I would have no hesitation in recommending Sam to anyone. Thank you Sam for all your help.
It’s simple with out Sam’s guidance and guidance I would have given up. A Huge company verses little me….how wrong I was, Sam had them tied up at every turn, always available for guidance and a bit of confidence building. Sam became that mate you could rely on. Don’t get me wrong it was still a battle but I had someone in my corner. In the end it was the company who gave up and the matter was settled. My wife and I can now get on with our future and the stress has gone…and yes it’s down to Sam..thanks mate.

“The best thing about Sam Stone and his business is that he has gone through this process himself so he understands the emotional roller coaster that one goes on when they find themselves in this situation. Sam is supportive and understanding as well as incredibly knowledgeable. If you find yourself in a position where you need to invoke the grievance procedure talk to Sam first he truly is one of the good people in this world. Thanks again for all your support Sam I truly could not have got through this without you.”
Mary
After working very successfully for my firm for over five years I was suspended from duty earlier in the year. I contacted Sam Stone via his website and he assisted me in lodging a grievance procedure against my Senior Management. I found Sam’s knowledge of the law and how to apply this knowledge to best effect, absolutely second to none. The support offered by Sam was exceptional and because of his expertise, all allegations made against myself by the company were withdrawn and we were able to agree upon a suitable settlement figure. I extremely grateful and very appreciative of all the work Sam put in to bring my case to a conclusion. Thank you very much Sam.
Ray.
My testimonial: If you ever find yourself needing help to raise a grievance against your place of employment you should seek the help of Mr Stone. He offers genuine help that enables you to fully present your grievance in the most coherent and professional manner. There’s no need to feel alone: there is help.You can present your case. And you can get justice if you have been wronged
Margaret
Sam, I Just wanted to put my appreciation on record for all your help through my wife’s grievance, starting with the grievance letter template, your assistance with the numerous correspondence exchanged with my wife’s obstinate employers’ and the countless telephone conversations during which you offered great guidance. There was great warmness and empathy in the way you interacted with me, especially on the phone which often felt like speaking to a very close friend … you are a true gentleman!
God bless, London.
I found the Formal Grievance website by chance whilst looking for a decent grievance letter template online for my wife. I decided to spend the £12.00 (unbelievable value, Sam it’s worth so much more) to download the template. As soon as I started to read through the wealth of information, I knew I had come to the right place. My wife was a union member, but the guidance she had received from her representative had been at best, wishy washy! With a few questions I had regarding compiling my wife’s letter, I phoned Sam and he simply astounded me with his vast knowledge and expertise on employment law. Within days, he had assisted us in compiling what I can only describe as ‘the mother of all grievance letters’! My wife’s employers had previously brushed her aside in any protestations she had had regarding their unfair treatment of her, but in short, the grievance letter tied them up in knots to such a degree that they asked her to settle financially. Sam, you are brilliant, and I cannot begin to thank you enough for your help and guidance with my wife and I on this. I genuinely feel privileged to have dealt with you, and wish you all the very best for the future.

Churchill once wrote ‘Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat.’
Before I found Sam Stone’s website, I spent 7 months in a battle of attrition against my employer. In that time I never had a victory. What ever I did, whatever tactic I employed, made no difference. The company outmanoeuvred me at every turn. It was the lowest point in my life and I knew in my own heart that I was beaten. I was literally a few weeks from being given the boot. I was the victim and I was still being victimised.
Then I had my own Alamein. I found Sam Stone.
After Sam Stone became involved I never had a defeat. He read through my case and told me he could help. His guidance still rings in my ears, despite a full year passing since I made the phone call. He told me it would be a difficult journey, one that would test the very fabric of my resolve and one that would be painful and fraught with uncertainties. But, and this is important, he told me that the employee was protected by very powerful laws, and he could help me. Boy was he right. Over the months Sam gave the sort of support you expect from a member of your closest family. He combined his encyclopaedic knowledge of the law and his ability to dissect the most relevant points of the case and link them to the law to outmanoeuvre my employer at every step of the journey. I placed my complete trust in Sam, listened to the choices he presented to me at all times. I never thought the pain would be over. It lasted nearly two years and in that time I lived it over and over in my head. I had the resolve but I didn’t have the knowledge. One without the other is like a gun without the bullets. Sam gave me the ammo. If you have any doubts about whether you should make the phone call to Sam, maybe you are embarrassed or ashamed at what is happening to you, maybe it feels so personal that you want to put your head in the sand and hope it all goes away, then take my guidance. Pick up the phone. Entrust your problems to my good buddy Sam Stone, and you will look back at the moment you make the phone call and be reminded of the quote from Winston Churchill.
Mark
Sam – I would like to thank you for your help regarding my work situation. Your website has enabled me to get a good solid understanding of the grievance procedure and together with your guidance I feel much better and confident about how to progress with the next steps. Thank you again for taking the time to speak to me.

Firstly, I just want to thank you Sam and let you know how grateful and total appreciative I am for all your help and support during these past few difficult months, you are definitely a guardian angel…I came across Sam’s website a few months ago when I was absolutely desperate for genuine and honest guidance regarding my work situation. I was feeling vulnerable and unwell due to how appalling I had been treated, being bullied and harassed by my employer. Sam is so knowledgeable in Employment Law. I would highly recommend contacting him in the first instance for employment issues and procedures – he is definitely without question the top of his game. He is an attentive listener and easy to talk to and has the professional ability to help you to understand legal terms and most of all genuinely cares. He explained the whole process in detail and what I could expect to happen. He is prompt and guides you step by step and he is always there for any follow up guidance that you need after submitting your grievance. I feel so lucky to have come across Sam, because I know that without him I would not have had the courage or confidence to fight my Employer for justice. Thank you so much Sam, I will always be grateful for your understanding and kindness.
God bless you. Alison
Sam helped me when nobody else was willing to do so. I can recommend him to anyone in need. Many thanks!’

I came into contact with Sam through his website formalgrievance.com. At the time I was about to submit my grievance letter which I had drafted myself (in an essay form). I had also consulted a solicitor for a free half an hour consultation. After going through Sam’s website and speaking to Sam on the phone, I realised what a mistake I would have made by submitting my formal grievance letter in its current state. I spoke to Sam and straight away knew this was a guy who had suffered my pain. Sam agreed to look at my letter and told me the problems with it. To cut a long story short I handed over the task of drafting the grievance letter to Sam at a reasonable fee. I now feel it is the best investment I have ever made. I realise that due to Sam’s passion I got a lot more then I bargained for. Due to my ill health Sam also helped me write letters to my employer and provided additional guidance. He became my support and a true friend during this very difficult time and was always available on the phone. Working with Sam it feels like he is your partner and friend, always available at the end of the phone (including weekend). Never ever have I heard from Sam the words “I am busy call me back”. During my grievance process I suffered heart attack and Sam was always there for me. Sam you are a true gentleman and human being with big heart, kind and passionate. Thank you very much and best of luck with your existing and future clients. I look forward to working with you again as my case progresses.
Kind Regards – Simon (Manchester)
Hi Sam, Many thanks for your time over the phone yesterday, it was much appreciated and exactly what I needed during this difficult time. It was good & reassuring to know I have somebody on my side to help me deal with my company. I also want to thank you for helping me with my grievance letter, it looks fantastic especially the wording and reference to the relevant law cases. I will definitely be seeking your guidance and guidance once the grievance process is underway. Take care and speak soon.
Lak – Birmingham
Sam, from the bottom of my heart I cannot thank you enough for helping me through this very dark time. I felt utter dispair facing this alone. You have been a star and I really cannot thank you enough for all your help.
Kind regards Linda
Dear Sam, Firstly, really appreciate the effort you are doing to keep your website full of absolutely great content. It is very informative and to the point. I believe I have made one of the best purchases by buying your Grievance Letter Aid. I wish I found you earlier when I raised my original grievance, nevertheless, I hope an addendum to my grievance would make the desired impact.

Sam, you are one of lifes true gentleman.
Jenny
I would highly recommend that Sam is the first call of port for anyone experiencing a grievance with their employer and needing a grievance letter. Although I had sought the guidance of a solicitor specialising in employment law, it was not until I came across the formalgrievance website and contacted Sam directly, did I get the right assistance and guidance. Sam was there to guide me through the grievance letter which made my employer respond in the correct and proper way. The formalgrievance website is extremely informative and focuses on the legal issues and procedures. I will always be grateful that Sam was there to advise me when my employers were behaving appalling and I was able to move on from my awful experience with the University that I was employed by. It is difficult enough for an employee to take on an institution, particularly one that has an endemic bullying culture, but with Sam’s assistance, I did just that and did it successfully.
Mary
Following a 30yr exemplary work record, I was unfortunate enough to be suspended from work. I thought at the time it would all blow over and I put my faith in my union rep and my Human Resources department. I quickly discovered that my union rep was of little help and only had the most basic knowledge of HR procedures. Rather than being treated fairly by the HR department I previously trusted, It became apparent I was a problem to be brushed under the carpet , with the likelihood I would be sacked. Throughout my 6 month suspension and with no support from my employers, I soon became despondent and felt I had deserved my circumstances. I came across Sam at formalgrievance through a web search to find online support from others in the same circumstance. At long last I felt supported and listened to. It was like a weight was lifted from my shoulders. I was astounded at Sam’s legal knowledge and prompt replies with sound guidance from experience. Several legal friends were impressed with his letters. His fees are very reasonable and he is worth every penny. I would recommend his services in an instant for anyone considering raising a grievance, suspended or facing suspension,and feeling bullied at work. It will be the best thing you will ever do.
Leah
The Formal Grievance Letter service was invaluable. I was supported from the very start right through to the appeal stage. In what has been a long and arduous process, it has been good to have a knowledgeable, experienced professional to help me to be heard and remain sane.
Juliet
I was extremely fortunate to find Sam through the internet. Initially I used his grievance letter template which helped me enormously and was worth the very nominal fee. Subsequently Sam has always been at the other end of the phone to offer guidance and support. He is passionate and informed and has a knowledge of employment law, second to none. He explains everything in detail, patiently and clearly. He has been my guardian angel and is worth his weight in gold. If I need employment guidance anytime in the future, Sam will be my first port of call.
Annie from Surrey
I had been happy in my current position at a medium sized company for 9 years until a new vice chairman and director came on board and my face no longer fit. I was harassed and intimidated by these people and my job was threatened by a new employee brought in by these people to take over my position. The final straw came when I was suspended on unsubstantiated allegations. I came across the Formal Grievance website two days after my suspension and since that day, with Sam’s help we have backed my employee into a corner that they are struggling to get out of. Sam drafted me a grievance letter and has responded to all of their disciplinary letters in such a way that they no longer know which way to turn. At present I am still suspended on full pay whilst my employee tries to untangle the legal web that Sam has spun and I feel confident that any legal route my employer tries to take me down, Sam will shut it down immediately. This man really is good and I am so glad I have him in my corner. I can guarantee I would have been unemployed without any compensation long ago if it were not for Sam. I cannot recommend Sam Stone highly enough.
Vincent
Coming across Sams website couldn’t have come at a better time for me. I was struggling to know where I stand with my employer, confused by all the jargon surrounding employment law and emotionally exhausted by the months of harrassment that had been inflicted on me by the company. I was ready to quit. Sams grievance letter template, and subsequent guidance has not only boosted my self confidence but given me the courage to push ahead with the grievance. His support has given me so much needed strength at a time where I thought the only option was to give in and move on. I’m sure my grievance letter is the first of many steps, but at least now I know there is someone out there who genuinely cares and will answer any questions I may have about the process. I would highly recommend Sam to anyone who has found themselves in a conflict situation with their employer and is unsure what to do next.

Sam, I learnt more from you in half an hour about employment law than the two solicitors I paid to have a consulation with regarding my grievances.
Cheers – Eric
Hi Sam, Just to say thankyou for my grievance letter. After ringing various people in Employment Law including Sam Stone, he was the only person to contact me. It was nice to have someone on your side and give guidance. I cannot thank him enough. Kind Regards – ****
Being a foreigner in the UK, I did not know my rights at work. I found Sam Stone to be a great source and human being to assist me in my time of difficulty. He was very informed regarding the law and was so supportive and very professional. He restored my faith in mankind again and I will always be greatful for his help and kindness. Thank you Sam.
Jane
I came across Sam’s website a few months ago when I was absolutely desperate for genuine and honest guidance regarding my work situation. I was feeling very vunerable and lost with what to do. Sam has a great natural skill to listen carefully and understand your situation and upset you are going through. He helped me step by step to understand legal terms and most of all how I had been treated and what rights I had. He explained the whole process in detail and what I could expect to happen. I have never come across anyone who genuinely cares and puts so much effort in what he does. His skills and experience are remarkable in employment law. I feel so lucky to have come across Sam, because I know that without him I would not have had the courage or confidence to fight my Employer for justice. It’s very rare to come across someone like Sam who genuiely wants to help you from the bottom of his heart. Thank you Sam and keep up the good work. God bless you.
Sarah
Hi Sam,
Thanks for the grievance note. To say was impressive would be an understatement.Very rarely can someone say a grievance note packs a Mike Tyson punch with a Johnny Cochran defense. His careful selection of words can make Shakespeare look like Ali G. The letter has an edge to it which is sharper than a serpent’s tooth. It will certainly stop HR ladies playing with their hair or filing the nails for a minute or two. I cant recommend you enough.
Ken London
Sam was a source of much appreciated support. The website alone provided me with invaluable information. The grievance letter template enabled me to draft a letter that gave me a sense of control in this otherwise daunting and dis-empowering situation, and the sense that someone, Sam, had the time to listen to me, hear me, and the skills to enable me to do something to improve my situation. My thanks, gratitude and appreciation Sam.

Sam has been a god send source of help and support had it not been for this I probably might not have any ground to stand on in my grievance. His professionalism, his understanding and genuine concern was invaluable. I am truly indebted to him for this. He has done the job of my union whom I had relied on and they had let me down. My grievance was a complex racial disability and religious discrimination and Sam encouraged me to take it all the way. I could not string anything together due to my illness yet with some input from myself he prepared my grievance. Even now when I need a friend to chat to and bounce ideas off he will quite willingly help. I sincerely believe he is one of the very few genuine do gooders left in the world. My family and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
Ahmed
Dear Sam,
Thank you so much for the help and support you gave me by drafting my grievance letter. Facing a hostile employer for months on end with no experience on how to respond to the continued bullying left me feeling truly dreadful but when I spoke with you it made me realise that this was something I didn’t need to face without support or guidance. I look forward to your continued guidance throughout the next phase of the grievance process. Your knowledge in this field is encycopedic and you are a true gentleman.
Kind Regards – Steve
Dear Sam, I cant thank you enough for how you have helped me. I was so distressed when I first spoke with you but you helped me to move forward. I dont know what I would have done without your professional knowlege and great guidance. I would highly recommend you to anyone who is ever unfortunate enough to be in a position like i was. Thank you for your support Sam!! You are a star for doing what you do! I certainly appreciated your service.
Karla – Romford
I do not know how to express my gratitude to you for the extremely helpful and well informed information you have provided in helping me put together my grievance letter. I felt very alone with the whole situation, which was adding to my stress and you have not only been an invaluable help to me in putting my letter together, but you have been a support. Thanks again.
Julie, Australia
You are to be congratulated on constructing such a useful and user friendly site. I found the information extremely helpful, especially in respect of my own current situation, which in parts I found uncannily parallel to my own grievance, which at the time of writing I am in the process of taking through the employment tribunal. Your sample grievance letter on the site is excellent and I easily adapted it to my own grievance and sent to my employer, thank you for that. I found your references to case law extremely useful and of great assistance to me in preparation of my submissions etc. Without being overtly patronising, I would say www.formalgrievance.co.uk is one of the best sites I have seen on the web in terms of being directly helpful to persons like myself who are experiencing similar problems. I have no doubt other unfortunate individuals in the same position as me will find the site provides a wealth of information to use in the inevitable battle employees face when trying to legitimately use the grievance procedure in a sincere attempt to resolve serious issues.  Again, thank you for providing such support through your site during a time when it is extremely difficult to find such practical and useful information. I also appreciate all the effort and hard work you have put in, especially in respect of the references to case law.

Sam, just to let you know I appreciate the time you took with me on the phone, and the opinions you expressed with regard to my grievance letter.

Hi Sam, thanx for all your help. Your grievance letter template was so good, my boss thought I had got a solicitor to draft my grievance letter. They were very careful with me after receiving the grievance letter, and fixed the problems, which were making me feel ill.
