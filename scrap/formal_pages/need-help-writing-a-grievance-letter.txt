Although the grievance procedure is not a quasi-judicial procedure, it would be prudent to make sure the grievance letter which you lodge, outlines a prima facie case against your employer, and where possible, including the law. This will potentially assist ACAS in providing pre-claim conciliation to obviate the litigative route via the Employment Tribunal.
In the event you refer to an Employment Tribunal, the employee [must] establish a [balance of probabilities] case against the employer. This places the [burden of proof] upon your employer to prove otherwise.
An employee who enters the grievance procedure, who fails to place the [burden of proof] upon their employer, will very likely find themselves being dealt with in a
heavy handed manner
. Your employer will simply allege that you were acting in bad faith, and that your grievances were without  substance or merit, viz: that what you have alleged, did not, on the balance of probabilities, occur.
Therefore, it is imperative to outline your employer’s [breaches] specific to its:
(i) relevant failures;
(ii) acts and omissions;
(iii) breaches of duties of care;
(iv) vicarious liability;
(v) torts;
(vi) breach of contract;
(vii) breach of mutual trust and confidence;
(viii) contraventions of ‘statutory duties’ germane to UK employment law/s.
If you need help writing a grievance letter to send to your employer, then contact us –
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or 07775943414 (9-5)
If you have written your own grievance letter, and would like a second opinion on what you have written, then send your letter of grievance to us –
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
If you would like us to simply beef up your grievance letter, and or make suggestions on what changes you may want to consider making to your own grievance letter, then send it to us –
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
Amy & I charge £35 (up to one hour) for an initial telephone consultation, which can be paid via credit or debit card via PayPal, and £50 an hour thereafter.
