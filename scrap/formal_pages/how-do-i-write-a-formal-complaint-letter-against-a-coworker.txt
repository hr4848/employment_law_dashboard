Date 6.6.25
Dear Manager (name),
RE: GRIEVANCE LETTER UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR AT WORK
I am writing a formal complaint letter against John Doe and Jane Smith for unprofessional behaviour at work.
The unprofessional behaviour of John and Jane at work, has caused and is causing
injury to my feelings
.
The conduct of John and Jane is impacting my physical and psychological health and wellbeing too. This grievance is therefore raised as a
health and safety
I am not sleeping very well and am dreading coming to work. I lay awake at night having ruminating thoughts about John and Jane’s treatment of me, which is affecting my health and well-being. My doctor has prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressant medication. Thus, a ‘causal link’ exists between the bullying and my doctor prescribing me with sleeping pills and anti-depressant medication.
Numerous incidents of unprofessional behaviour has ultimately led to a
toxic work environment
in which to communicate with Jane and John.
On 5.5.25, John Doe shouted at me across the office in front of my workplace colleagues. This was humiliating and embarrassing as I felt all eyes were on me. John demeaned me, belittled me, and castigated me in front of my workplace colleagues, which undermined the implied term of
mutual trust and confidence
in them.
However, and for the avoidance of doubt, this was not the first incident whereby John and Jane have created a hostile, oppressive, and intimidating work environment. On the 4.4.25, I walked into the office and greeted everyone by saying “good morning”. Jane asked me what was so good about this particular morning. John then laughed at me and repeated the question. I just stated I was being pleasant by greeting my fellow workplace colleagues. Jane then also laughed at me, rolled her eyes, and looked at other workplace colleagues making out I was deluded. This was really uncomfortable for me. John then muttered something under his breath. I did not hear what John stated, but later my workplace colleague (Betty Davis) told me that John Doe had called me a “bitch”.
I expect my employer to take
reasonable steps
to put an end to this treatment, which treatment is making me feel ill, and moreover, which treatment is having a profound and detrimental impact on both my physical and psychological health and wellbeing. To this end, I am asking my employer to promote, champion, and embed a working environment with both dignity and respect, and which is free from
bullying and harassment
at work.
For the avoidance of doubt, be called a “bitch” is harassment related to my sex and amounts to
sexual harassment
. I very much Doubt John would have called a male employee a “bitch”. Therefore, my sex was a contributing cause for the unlawful harassment.
Please confirm receipt of this grievance letter as a letter of complaint for unprofessional behaviour by my co-workers.
The above grievance complaint letter template for unprofessional behaviour at work, outlines both ‘facts and information’ i.e., what happened, when it happened, and who the culprits are, including the name of a witness.
The above grievance complaint letter template for unprofessional behaviour at work, also outlines a complaint for “bullying and harassment” which automatically becomes a ‘protected act’ in accordance with
s.27(2)(d) of The Equality Act 2010
. Put shortly, making a complaint of ‘harassment’ is a ‘protected act’ which protects you from ‘victimisation’ by either your employer, boss, or co-workers.
Moreover, by using the grievance letter template above for unprofessional behaviour at work above, you are also raising your grievances as “health and safety” matters in accordance with
s.44(1)(c) of The Employment Rights Act 1996:
“He brought to his employer’s attention, by reasonable means, circumstances connected with his work which he reasonably believed were harmful or potentially harmful to health or safety”.
