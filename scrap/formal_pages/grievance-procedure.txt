ACAS Need Help Writing A Letter of Grievance To Your Employer:
Do yourself a favour, and take a minute to read this webpage.
This page last updated 6.6.25.
Q: Why write a grievance letter to your employer at all, why not just express your grievances verbally?
A: The ACAS Code of Practice are written guidelines for both employers and employees’ to follow. If you fail to follow the ACAS Code of Practice, an Employment Tribunal could reduce your claim by 25%. Why give your employer this opportunity? In order to observe the ACAS Code of Practice you have to put your grievances in writing. However, there is no set format in which to raise a written grievance letter other than to outline your complaints in writing to your employer. For the avoidance of doubt, you do not even have to state your letter is a ‘grievance’ letter:-
Shergold v Fieldway Medical Centre
[2006] IRLR 76, EAT on 5th December 2005, reported at [2006] ICR 304.
“All that is required is that a grievance must be set out in writing.”
However, many legal websites will inform you that you do not need a grievance letter template. Trust me when I tell you, they are wrong.
The Following Applies:
Given the fact that most employees’ have no knowledge of employment law, by failing to write an articulate grievance letter which encompasses points of employment law, you will have played right into your employer’s hands. What many employees’ fail to articulate is that on the balance of probabilities, your employer will likely have an agreement with a law firm who will vet an employee’s grievance letter which it receives.
As such, when you lodge your grievance letter with your employer, chances are you think you are dealing with your employer’s HR Department. In truth, you are dealing with your employer’s solicitors without ever knowing it. Writing a grievance letter is much like trying to bake bread for the first time; chances are you will get it wrong first time around. The difference being, you only get one chance to write your grievance letter!
This is why Amy & I have written a ‘
grievance template letter
‘ to help employee’s just like you. Truth be told, the
grievance letter template aid
gives you an insight into the mechanics of writing a grievance letter to your employer. You do not have to use the grievance letter template verbatim, you can cut and paste what you want from the grievance letter template aid. The fact remains the grievance letter template is an ‘aid ‘to assist you in writing a better letter of grievance to your employer.
Furthermore, the grievance letter template is broken down into three sections.
Section one deals with employee’s who are suffering from work related stress.
Section two is for employee’s who are being subjected to bullying and harassment at work.
Section three is to do with unlawful discrimination at work.
The
grievance letter template aid
also contains points of law and legal precedents. It also uses legal terminology in a way which you can understand. Furthermore, the grievance letter template aid outlines the steps you want to take before you lodge a letter of grievance with your employer, and the common mistakes you want to avoid.
My wife Amy & I get to see and read all manner of employees’ grievance letters. Truth be told, they would have done themselves a big favour had they taken the half hour to have read through the grievance letter template aid on how to write a grievance letter to your employer.  We speak from the heart when we say to you that having been subjected to a systematic campaign of bullying at work ourselves, Amy & I know first-hand the stress and anxiety it causes. The frustration, sleepless nights, heart palpitations and anger you feel now Amy & I have already felt, because we have already trodden the path, which you now tread.
In my case, my GP subsequently signed me off from work with work related stress, panic attacks and depression. Whilst off from work on sickness absence, I spent the next year living in the local law library bottoming the law, with express particular s.13(1); s.15(1)(a)(b); s.19(1)(2)(3); s.20(3); s.26(1)(a)(b)(i)(ii)(4)(5); s.27(1)(2); s.39(2)(4)(5) and s.109(4)(a)(b) of the Equality Act 2010.
I also blew the whistle under s.43B(1)(b)(d) of the ERA 1996 on my employer’s torts.
Furthermore, I asserted my statutory rights under s.44(1)(d) of the ERA 1996 and refused to return to work by reason that my employer had failed to facilitate me with a safe place and system of work, being free from further harassment and disruption:-
Wigan Borough Council v Davies [1979] ICR 411
“An implied term in contracts of employment is that the employer will provide reasonable support to ensure that the employee can carry out his/her duties without harassment or disruption by fellow workers; and where an employer has an obligation to take reasonable steps to achieve something and takes few or no steps, the onus of proving what steps would have been reasonable is on the employer.”
Let me tell you something my friend, my employer picked a fight with the wrong employee. As a former boxer I put up a fight which consequentially ran my employer up a legal bill into the hundreds of thousands of pounds. For the avoidance of doubt, every now and again an employer will run into a junk yard dog like me who tears the bastards apart. The fact remains, few employees have the stomach to give their employer a good mauling. Forewarned is forearmed, do yourself a favour and learn what Amy & I have learnt about employment law and the follies of the grievance procedure. Purchasing the
grievance letter template aid
will be the best twelve quid you will have ever spent – you have my word on it.
