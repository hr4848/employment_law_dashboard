How to handle a disciplinary hearing as an employee?
Question – How to beat disciplinary hearings?
Answer – The less you say in the disciplinary hearing the better. Most people subjected to a disciplinary hearing tend to ramble on at the disciplinary hearing. This is a mistake. The less you say at the disciplinary hearing the better. Remember – ‘less is more’. Stay in control during the disciplinary hearing or disciplinary investigatory meeting. Keep your answers short and to the point. Answer questions at the disciplinary hearing in as few words as possible without appearing to be evasive. We have created a
disciplinary hearing template
to assist you in knowing the do’s and don’ts when attending a disciplinary workplace investigation or disciplinary hearing. The
disciplinary hearing template
is only £16 and is 30 pages long.
Question – Can you be sacked at a disciplinary hearing?
Answer – Yes, but it is highly unlikely that you would be sacked at a disciplinary hearing. The reason why you are very unlikely to be sacked at a disciplinary hearing is that an Employment Tribunal would draw an ‘adverse inference’ that your employer did not take a ‘reasonable timeframe’ to consider matters, which you raised during the disciplinary hearing. Sacking you at a disciplinary hearing could result in a claim for unfair dismissal. It is highly likely that an employer would take a day or two after the disciplinary hearing to sack you rather than actually sacking you whilst attending the disciplinary hearing.
Question – Suspended from work pending investigation what are my rights?
Answer – The Court of Appeal has held that suspension from work is NOT a “neutral act” because suspension from work changes the “status quo from work to no work”. My wife Amy & I have created a grievance letter template for you to submit to your employer if you have been suspended from work. Please see our
suspension from work webpage
.
Question – What happens after an investigation meeting?
Answer – After an investigation meeting the employer will consider your answers at the disciplinary hearing, and take into consideration any mitigation, which you provided during the disciplinary hearing. Any decision made by the employer after the disciplinary investigatory meeting has to be fair and equitable, otherwise your employer runs the risk of you bringing a claim for ‘unfair dismissal’. If you are concerned about the disciplinary investigatory meeting or attending a disciplinary hearing, we suggest you contact us during business hours (9-5) at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414. It is always better to seek our assistance before attending the disciplinary workplace investigation meeting, or disciplinary hearing.
Question – What are workplace investigation outcomes?
Answer – The outcomes to a workplace investigation can result in a written warning, a final written warning, or dismissal. It is more likely that your employer will give you a written warning as part of the workplace investigation outcome. However, if the employer believes that your conduct amounts to ‘gross misconduct’ you may be dismissed. Thus, when inviting you to a disciplinary hearing, the disciplinary hearing invite letter will usually outline whether or not your employer considers your conduct to be “gross misconduct”. If the letter inviting you to a workplace investigation meeting or disciplinary hearing states that one of the outcomes is “gross misconduct” or “dismissal” we suggest you reach out to us during business hours (9-5) at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414. It is always better to seek our assistance before attending the disciplinary workplace investigation meeting or disciplinary hearing.
Question – I am being investigated at work what are my rights UK?
Answer – You have the right to a fair and equitable disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. You will usually be asked to attend a disciplinary investigatory meeting before actually being invited to attend a ‘disciplinary hearing’. The first step is an investigatory meeting. If after the disciplinary investigatory meeting, the employer believes there has been wrongdoing on your part, then your employer will send you a further letter inviting you to attend a ‘disciplinary hearing’. We suggest you reach out to us during business hours (9-5) at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414 in the event you have been invited to attend a workplace investigation meeting or disciplinary hearing. It is far better for us to prepare you in advance of attending the disciplinary meeting then after the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing has already occurred. We can walk you through the steps your employer will likely take, and moreover, assist you in answering any questions you may be asked as part of the disciplinary hearing. We can also assist you in formulating a strategy for the disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. Put shortly, you don’t want to be a lapdog during the disciplinary process. You need to be robust in defending yourself, and furthermore, in adducing and eliciting the facts and information to properly argue your case
prior
to attending a disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. This strategy is outlined in the following case authorities:
Spink v Express Foods Limited
[1990] IRLR 320:
“It is a fundamental part of a fair disciplinary procedure that an employee know the case against him. Fairness requires that someone accused should know the case to be met; should hear or be told the important parts of the evidence in support of that case;
should have an opportunity to criticise or dispute that evidence and to adduce his own evidence and argue his case
.”
Bentley Engineering Co Ltd v Mistry
[1979] ICR 47:
“Employers disciplinary proceedings require that an employee should have a chance to state his own case and to know sufficiently what was being said against him,
so that he could put forward his own case properly, and have a chance to state his own case in detail
. The employee must know in one way or another sufficiently what is being said against him. If the employee does not know sufficiently what is being said against him, he cannot properly put forward his own case. This encompasses the employee either being allowed to see witness statements against him or be allowed to listen to what witnesses have to say about him.”
Question – How to avoid dismissal for gross misconduct?
Answer – If you want to avoid dismissal for gross misconduct, my wife Amy & I can assist you in preparing a strategy for the disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. Put shortly, piss poor planning leads to piss poor performance. Hence, if you want to avoid being dismissed for gross misconduct, please reach out to us to book a consultation during business hours (9-5) at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414. We charge £35 for an initial consultation up to one hour, and £50 an hour thereafter.
We can assist you in articulating the case against you, defending yourself, and knowing what to say and what not what to say at a disciplinary hearing. The key here is not to be obstructive or defensive, but rather to be seen to be acting reasonably, even if you are not actually acting reasonably. Amy and I have helped hundreds of clients over the last 14 years to beat disciplinary hearings. Please see our
testimonials page
.
Question – Disciplinary meeting tips for nervous employee?
Answer – It is only natural that you will be nervous when attending a disciplinary hearing. Your employer counts on this. The more you rabbit on in the disciplinary hearing due to your nerves, the more you will undermine yourself. Less is more. The less you say at the disciplinary hearing the better. Keep your answers during the disciplinary meeting succinct, short, and to the point. Don’t waffle or feel obligated to speak if there is silence during the disciplinary hearing or disciplinary investigatory meeting. We have created a template to assist you if you are invited to attend a disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. The template assists you in knowing the do’s and don’ts when attending a disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing. Please
click here
to purchase the template, which is only £16.
Question – Disciplinary hearing questions?
Answer – If you have a medical condition such as Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, ADHD, Autism, Aspergers, Cancer, Asthma, Migraines etc, you can ask your employer (as a reasonable adjustment) to send you the list of questions, which your employer wants to ask you at the disciplinary investigatory meeting or disciplinary hearing 48 hours in advance of the disciplinary hearing taking place. If your employer fails to make this adjustment, we suggest you raise a
grievance for disability discrimination
.
A failure to make a
reasonable adjustment
is a contravention of s.39(2)(b)(5) of The Equality Act 2010.
It is incumbent upon your employer not to put you at a disadvantage during the disciplinary hearing because of an impairment or disability you have. If you feel that your employer is discriminating against you, please reach out to us to book a consultation during business hours (9-5) at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414. We charge £35 for an initial consultation up to one hour, and £50 an hour thereafter.
Question – Flawed disciplinary investigation:
Answer – What to do if you have been subjected to a flawed disciplinary investigation. In short, contact us at
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
or call us on 07775943414. We charge £35 for an initial consultation up to one hour, and £50 an hour thereafter. We can assist you in drafting a letter of grievance or complaint letter if you have been subjected to a flawed disciplinary investigation. An employer who undertakes a flawed disciplinary investigation is not only in breach of the implied term of
mutual trust and confidence
, a flawed disciplinary investigation also perverts the
natural justice
.
An employer undertaking a flawed disciplinary investigation is very likely to lead to the aggrieved employee lodging a formal grievance letter. In fact, if you don’t ‘object, protest, and challenge’ the flawed disciplinary investigation, then you would be seen as ‘affirming and acquiescing’ to the flawed disciplinary process especially if you are dismissed. The consequences for an employee who does not object, protest, and challenge a flawed disciplinary process were succinctly outlined in the cause authority of
Mr J Hargreaves v Governing Body of Manchester Grammar School
UKEAT/0048/18/DA, whereas the Employment Appeal Tribunal drew an ‘adverse inference’ that the employee had not advised his employer (the respondent) that his suspension was “inappropriate” or that the disciplinary investigation was flawed. DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!
Question – Signs your case will be dismissed UK?
Answer – we would suggest that your case is likely to be dismissed if your employer cannot adduce ‘evidence’ as part of a disciplinary investigation or disciplinary hearing. Put shortly, without actual ‘evidence’, it could be argued that it is not justifiable to take disciplinary action against you.
Question – Employee rights in disciplinary meetings / How to handle a disciplinary hearing as an employee?
Answer – as stated above, you have the right to a fair and equitable disciplinary investigation and disciplinary hearing. If the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing is not fair and equitable, then raise a formal grievance. If you do not raise a formal grievance letter to complain about an unfair disciplinary meeting or unfair disciplinary hearing, the Employment Tribunal will draw an ‘adverse inference’ on your ‘
omission
‘ to have complained. Case in point, see
Mr J Hargreaves v Governing Body of Manchester Grammar School
UKEAT/0048/18/DA.
In a disciplinary investigatory meeting you do
not
have a statutory right to be accompanied unless you have an impairment or disability. However, you
do
have a statutory right to be accompanied by a workplace colleague or trade union representative to a ‘disciplinary hearing’. If you have an impairment or disability, you could ask as a
reasonable adjustment
that you are allowed to have a family member of friend as your chosen companion at both the disciplinary investigatory meeting and also at the disciplinary hearing.
If you have already been ambushed into a disciplinary investigatory meeting please visit our
workplace investigation webpage
, which webpage has many useful tips on what do do during workplace investigations (whether grievance or disciplinary workplace investigations).
The disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing must not create an ‘oppressive environment’ and must be undertaken with both dignity and respect by both employee and employer. Thus, if the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing becomes hostile and oppressive stop the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing and object to being treated in the manner you are. If you suffer from anxiety, depression, migraines, ADHD, autism, cancer, PTSD you could raise a formal
grievance letter for harassment
. You could argue that the hostile disciplinary hearing is triggering a migraine or anxiety attack. This would give you grounds to postpone the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing and contact us – myrightsuk@protonmail.com
The persons who undertake the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing must not have a conflict of interest. If the persons undertaking the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing do have a conflict of interest, make sure you outline this both verbally at the disciplinary hearing and also in writing (via email) straight after the disciplinary hearing. Do not continue with the disciplinary meeting or disciplinary hearing if the persons or panel have a conflict of interest.
Personally, we would always audio record a disciplinary meeting and disciplinary hearing. Please purchase our
£16 template
which template covers the do’s and don’ts of attending disciplinary hearings, including the legality of making
covert recordings,
