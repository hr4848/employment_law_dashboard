Workplace Harassment What to do?
Workplace Harassment What to do?
Questions we commonly get asked:
What do I do if you experience workplace harassment?
Workplace harassment what should I do UK?
My wife Amy & I are employment consultants with 26 years combined experience helping people like you know what to do if you are being subjected to workplace harassment. Amy and I created this website because we too were subjected to workplace harassment and took our employers to the Employment Tribunal.
You don’t have to tolerate workplace harassment. Most people don’t complain of workplace harassment to begin with. It is only when the workplace harassment becomes more systemic that most people report the workplace harassment. So, Amy & I have outlined some bullet points below to assist you in knowing what to do if you have been or are being subjected to workplace harassment:
Call us on 07775943414 (business hours 9-5) to arrange a consultation. We charge £35 for an initial telephone consultation up to one hour. During the call we can discuss what to do, and how we can help you. If out of hours email us – myrightsuk@protonmail.com
Do NOT speak to Human Resources about workplace harassment until you speak to us first. Remember, the Human Resources Department are there to protect the employer, not you. In fact, the Human Resources Department are there to mitigate your employer’s liability.
The first thing for Amy & I to do is establish if the workplace harassment is actually harassment as defined by The Equality Act 2010. It may be that the harassment is also discrimination too.
Keep an electronic diary. Every time you are subjected to workplace harassment email yourself outlining what happened and who was present, including the date and time.
Don’t engage in workplace banter. Most of us will just try and laugh workplace harassment off. However, workplace harassment is no laughing matter.
Where an employer fails to take what the employee tells him seriously, it may give rise to the employee making a claim for
constructive dismissal
as held in the authority of
Wigan Borough Council v Davies 1979:
“There is an implied term in contracts of employment that the employer will provide reasonable support to ensure that the employee can carry out his/her duties without harassment or disruption by fellow workers; and where an employer has an obligation totake reasonable steps to achieve something and takes few or no steps, the onus of proving what steps would have been reasonable is on the employer.”
An employer’s failure to take ‘reasonable and practicable steps’ to prevent workplace harassment, will likely make the employer “vicariously liable” for the harasser/s acts pursuant to s.109 of the Equality Act 2010. This means that the employer could be “
vicariously liable
” for the harasser’s conduct, whether the employer knows workplace harassment is happening or not.
Pursuant to s.110(1)(a)(b)(c)(2) of the Equality Act 2010, the harasser is personally liable for their own acts of workplace harassment. When we draft your grievance letter for harassment for you, we will make sure that the harasser is made aware that they are personally liable for the harassment they have subjected you to. For the avoidance of doubt, when I sued my wife’s employer for sexual harassment and sex discrimination, I sued the harasser personally too. I can tell you, nothing puts the fear of God into a person who discriminates or harasses you when they are personally served with an Employment Tribunal claim in accordance with s.110(1)(a)(b)(c)(2) and s.112(1) of the EqA 2010.
Notwithstanding, if other persons at work aids, induces, or causes workplace harassment, that person can also be held to account pursuant to s.111 of the Equality Act 2010. This is really useful when you have a group of bullies who egg each other on (workplace mobbing).
My wife Amy & I are employment consultants with 26 years combined experience. We can assist you in obviating the common mistakes, which we often see employees make when raising a grievance letter for workplace harassment. You only get one chance to get your grievance letter for workplace harassment right, so make sure that you do! Amy & I can have a telephone consultation with you or write you a custom letter of grievance if:

Sexual Harrassment
Bracebridge Engineering Ltd v Darby
[1990] IRLR 3 EAT
A single act of harassment if it is sufficiently serious will be unlawful discrimination.
Canniffe v East Riding of Yorkshire Council [2000] IRLR 555, EAT
The existence of an employer’s formal policy against sex harassment is not necessarily enough on its own to amount to an adequate defence against a sex discrimination claim by an employee arising from sex harassment. To havea valid defence, an employer must prove that it took such steps as were reasonably practicable to prevent the employee from doing the sex discriminatory act. Therefore if the employer has not taken such steps, it cannot escape liability by showing that the discriminatory act would have taken place even if it had taken them.
Beadles Group Ltd v Angelica Graham
The employer had no written policy on either sex discrimination/harassment, or equal opportunities, and did not provide training or advice to ordinary employees about sexual harassment, or warn them against it. Ms Graham was awarded £180,000
Reed v Steadman [1999] IRLR 299
The Employment Appeal Tribunal held that, in relation to sexual harassment, the issue is whether “the words or conduct [are] unwelcome to the victim and it is for her to decide what is acceptable or offensive. The question is not what (objectively) the employer/tribunal would or would not find offensive.”
Fletcher and Steele v Cannon Hygiene Ltd
A failure by an employer to separate two women from their female harasser amounted to harassment. The employer failed to take sufficient steps to protect them from further sex harassment. This case takes into account the European Commission Code of Practice on Sex Harassment 1991 to separate the victim from the alleged harasser.
Insitu Cleaning Co Ltd v Heads [1995] IRLR 4
The EAT held that a ‘sexual remark’ was discriminatory. Mrs. Heads was greeted in a meeting by the words “Hiya, big tits”. She found the remark “very embarrassing” and “distressing”. The tribunal found that the remark was sufficiently serious to constitute a “detriment” for which her employer’s were “vicariously liable”.
