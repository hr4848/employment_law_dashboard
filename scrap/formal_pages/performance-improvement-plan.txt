Performance Improvement Plan Employee Rights UK:
This page last updated 6.6.25.
Do you need to know how to fight and beat a performance improvement plan?
Do you want to know how to complain and respond to an unfair performance improvement plan?
Have you been subjected to a performance improvement plan without warning?
Then read on.
For the avoidance of doubt, the performance improvement plan or PIP is the fastest way for an employer to ‘legally’ give an employee the boot on grounds of ‘capability’ under s.98 of The Employment Rights Act 1996:
“Capability
in relation to an employee, means his capability assessed by reference to skill, aptitude, health or any other physical or mental quality”.
Over the last 13 years, my wife Amy & I have sucessfully helped countless clients fight and beat a performance improvement plan.
Question 1 = How to fight and beat an unfair performance improvement plan?
Below, we have outlined examples and samples of how to fight and beat a performance improvement plan:
We suggest looking for the flaws with your employer’s ‘motivation’ behind putting you on a performance improvement plan. Usually, the performance improvement plan is initiated because your manager wants to get rid of you and replace you with somebody they know, or in the alternative, the employer is making redundancies and wants to avoid having to pay you redundancy. Thus, question the manager’s ‘motivation’ behind the performance improvement plan to establish the real ‘reason’ behind the PIP.
State (in writing
via email
) why the performance improvement plan is unfair. By putting your complaint in writing, you will automatically be raising a grievance letter. For the avoidance of doubt, any ‘complaint in writing’ is a grievance as held in the authority of
Shergold v Fieldway Medical Centre
Always challenge the performance improvement plan both verbally (if ambushed into a meeting), then
via email
after the performance improvement plan meeting. Make sure you take a screen shot of the complaint you raise including the date, time, and name of the person you sent the email to.
Ascertain with the employer when the alleged performance issues allegedly began. It is imperative that you establish with your employer the date it is alleged your performance was not up to the ‘required standard’.
Ask your employer to outline the ‘specific support’, which was given to you after the employer first became aware of any issues with your alleged performance, including the nature of that support.
Ask your employer for the date/s any support was given to you, and furthermore, under what auspices that support was given to you to assist you in overcoming any alleged performance issues at work. Put shortly, it would be unreasonable for your manager or employer to put you on a performance improvement plan without bringing performance matters to your attention at the ‘material time’ they knew there were shortcomings regarding your performance. You could argue the omission to have informed you of your alleged performance issues has impinged on the implied term of
mutual trust and confidence
.
If you have a
medical condition
such as anxiety, depression or you are going through the menopause, ask your employer what mitigation (if any) has been considered given the effect of your physical or mental impairment on your day-to-day activities.
If you have a
medical condition
ask your employer what reasonable adjustments (if any) were implemented. If your employer has assessed your performance without
reasonable adjustments
, raise a grievance letter for
disability discrimination
.
Ask your employer what ‘standard’ it is alleged that you were ‘required’ to adhere to, and moreover, how and when that ‘standard’ was made clear to you. For example, most of the performance improvement plans, which Amy & I see are worded something like:
“You are not performing to the ‘required standard’.”
Thus, you have every right to ask the employer how they made you aware of the ‘standard’ which you were ‘required’ to perform to i.e., before being placed on the performance improvement plan.

Question 2 = Performance improvement plan employees rights UK?
Ascertain what adjustments your employer put in place to remove the disadvantage caused by your medical condition, impairment, or disability.
Raise a grievance against your manager if you have not been rendered with ‘reasonable support’, which is a statutory requirement under the auspices of Section 2(2)(c) of The HSAWA 1974.
Do not agree to the performance improvement plan.
Do NOT sign the PIP or else you will affirm and acquiesce to the performance improvement plan (affirmation). The reason why you should never sign the PIP is  because you are agreeing to the fact your performance was not up to the employer’s ‘required standard’. Thus, if you later try and claim unfair dismissal the employer will state that if you felt the performance improvement plan was unfair, that on the balance of probabilities, you would not have signed the PIP.
You can object to the performance improvement plan by informing your employer you intend to raise a formal letter of grievance regarding the reasoning,  rational, and motivation for the performance improvement plan. As stated above, usually the performance improvement plan is initiated because the manager wants you gone.
Challenge any allegations against you regarding your alleged performance.
Point the finger of blame onto HR and management for failing to assist you and support you in meeting their ‘expectations’ of you, and furthermore, what was ‘required’ of you.
Ask for the policy or procedures, which the employer is utilising, which policy and procedures governs the’ expectations of management’, and how this policy and procedures were communicated to you before putting you on a performance improvement plan.
Challenge any timeframe, which the employer gives you for improving your performance. Usually, a minimum of 3 months is reasonable, but not if you have a disability, impairment, or medical condition.
Ask why any alleged shortcomings in your performance were not raised with you during your 1-2-1’s.
Outline how the performance improvement plan is unfair given the fact your alleged performance issues were never discussed during 1-2-1 meetings with your manager.
Outline the fact that if your manager was genuinely concerned about any shortcomings in your performance, that on the balance of probabilities, your manager would have documented any performance issues with you during your 1-2-1’s.
Make a Subject Access Request for all 1-2-1 meetings with your manager.
Make a Subject Access Request for all emails and minutes of any meetings with HR, or other senior managers regarding your performance.
If your manager has failed to keep notes during the 1-2-1 meetings with you, evidence the laissez-faire attitude of your manager in managing your performance. Use this against your manager.
Question 3 = What to say in a performance improvement plan meeting?
Do NOT go on the defensive.
Instead, go on the ‘offensive’ and challenge the performance improvement plan as outlined above.
Be firm, but not aggressive. Our
£16 template
covers the legalities of making covert recordings.
Object, protest, and challenge the performance improvement plan.
Do not agree to any allegations regarding your performance especially if you are ambushed into a meeting without knowing the nature of the meeting in advance. Simply say – “I do not agree with the PIP and will be raising a formal grievance letter”.
Contact us – myrightsuk@protonmail.com or call us on 07775943414 (9-5).
Remember, under s.98 of The ERA 1996, the employer can fairly dismiss you on grounds of ‘capability’.
Amy and I have created a Performance Improvement Plan Grievance Letter Template to assist you in challenging the PIP. The performance improvement plan template outlines three grievance letter examples for three different scenarios. You can use the three grievance letter performance improvement plan examples within the Performance Improvement Plan Template to raise a letter of grievance to your employer to object, protest and challenge the performance improvement plan. The three grievance letter examples for the performance improvement plan can be used either verbatim or to support a grievance letter, which you are already writing. Know your employment rights UK when put in a PIP!

I myself was placed on a PIP by my previous employer after I raised a grievance for disability discrimination, so I know first hand the injustice, which you feel having been placed on a PIP.
The majority of time, the real reasons why the employer instigated the performance improvement plan, is for one of the following reasons:
Because the employer is making redundancies, and wants to save money by managing people out of the Company by using the performance improvement plan as the vehicle to procure [your] dismissal;
A new manager has started, who is indifferent to you, and whom is acting in a capricious manner to get rid of you. Chances are, the manager already has your replacement waiting in the wings.
The employer needs to downsize.
Is the performance improvement plan fair, and more importantly, within the range of reasonable responses?
The answer to this question lays in looking at employment law.
Pursuant to s.98(3) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, it states that an employer can dismiss an employee for grounds relating to ‘capability’. This means – “In relation to an employee, his capability assessed by reference to skill, aptitude, health or any other physical or mental quality.”
Yes, the employer can lawfully dismiss you on grounds of (a) capability (b) skill (c) aptitude and/or (d) health, which would fall within the range of reasonable responses –
British Home Stores Ltd v Burchell
[1978] IRLR 379.
