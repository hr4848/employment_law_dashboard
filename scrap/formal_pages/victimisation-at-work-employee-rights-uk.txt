What is victimisation at work?
Are you being subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace and need to know how to write a grievance letter to complain about bullying and victimisation at work?
Read on:
Victimisation in the workplace occurs where you have made a complaint (either verbally or in writing) about:
Harassment in the workplace
Discrimination in the workplace
Victimisation in the workplace
Victimisation in the workplace can also occur where you have blown the whistle and are being subjected to ‘detrimental treatment’ done on the grounds that you blew the whistle. In accordance with
s.47B of The Employment Rights Act 1996
, it is unlawful to subject a person to detrimental treatment done on the grounds that they have blown the whistle. For the avoidance of doubt, bullying and victimisation in the workplace is a form of ‘detrimental treatment’.
What is ‘detrimental treatment’ or ‘detriment’?
Take the meaning of the word ‘detriment’ as it is used in every day parlance.
Put shortly, if you have been (or are being) subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace, then that bullying and victimisation is very likely to be to the ‘detriment’ of your mental health.
You can also be subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace if you have blown the whistle, or if you have raised a complaint (whether verbally or in writing) about harassment or discrimination. The same applies if you have raised health and safety concerns at work.
In the authority of
St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council v Derbyshire
[2007] IRLR 540 HL the following position was held by the House of Lords at paragraph 66:
“Secondly, under the victimisation provisions, it is primarily from the perspective of the alleged victim that one determines the question whether or not any “detriment”
(in this case, in section 6(2)(b) of the 1975 Act) has been suffered. However, the reasoning in Khan suggests that the question whether a particular act can be said to amount to victimisation must be judged from the point of view of the alleged discriminator. Of course, the words “by reason that” require one to consider why the employer has taken the particular act (in this case the sending of the two letters) and to that extent one must assess the alleged act of victimisation from the employer’s point of view
. However, in considering whether the act has caused detriment, one must view the issue from the point of view of the alleged victim.”
It is important to note that the ‘concept of detriment’ is very broad. Moreover, the concept of detriment has to be established from your point of view as the complainant as held in the authority of
Jesudason v Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust
[2020] EWCA Civ 73 at paragraph 27:
“The concept of detriment is very broad and must be judged from the viewpoint of the worker.”
What is victimisation at Work?
Below are victimisation examples of bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
Being subjected to micro management.
Being performance managed or being placed on a
performance improvement plan
.
Being subjected to a capability where malicious allegations are raised against you in a tit for tat move by your employer.
Being accused of bullying a workplace colleague.
Being demoted.
Being subjected to
workplace mobbing
by your workplace colleagues.
Being alienated by your workplace colleagues.
Not being invited to meetings.
Not being told about meetings.
Being set up to fail with unrealistic performance targets.
Having your management role diminished.
Having annual leave declined for no legitimate reason.
Being subjected to a
hostile, oppressive, and intimidating
working environment.
Being humiliated in meetings.
All of the above are examples of being subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace.
Moreover, victimisation at work can also happen because you have raised health and safety concerns at work.
What is victimisation in the workplace?
Victimisation at work occurs after you make a complaint (either verbally or in writing) about feeling harassed or discriminated against.
Victimisation at work can also occur after you make a complaint (either verbally or in writing) about health and safety matters at work or where you have blown the whistle.
Thus, if you are being subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace, then reach out to Amy and I to assist you in writing a grievance letter to put a stop to the bullying and victimisation at work.
In accordance with
s.27(2)(d) of The Equality Act 2010
, making a complaint about harassment or discrimination at work is a ‘protected act’. Therefore, it is unlawful for a person or your employer to bully and victimise you ‘by reason that’ you have made a complaint about harassment or discrimination at work.
In accordance with
s.47B of The Employment Rights Act 1996
, it is unlawful to subject a person to detrimental treatment ‘done on the grounds that’ they have blown the whistle.
Victimisation Example = making a complaint whether verbally or in writing about (i) harassment; (ii) discrimination in the workplace; (iii) health and safety issues at work; (iv) or for blowing the whistle at work.
How to stop bullying and victimisation at work?
Victimisation is a form of discrimination. To this end, if you have complained at work about being harassed or discriminated against and you have been (or are being) subjected to bullying and victimisation in the workplace for speaking out, then reach out to Amy and I to help you to write a grievance letter to put an end to the bullying and victimisation at work. The same applies in the event you have raised health and safety issues at work and are now being bullied and victimised because you have raised health and safety complaints.
Amy & I find that more often than not it is the Human Resources Department who subjects the employee to bullying and victimisation for speaking out about harassment and discrimination at work. Put shortly, the HR Department are usually the culprits who bully and victimise employees who speak out at work to put an end to a
toxic work environment
.
The job role of the HR Department is to create a working environment with both dignity and respect, being a working environment free from bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation. However, more often than not, my wife Amy & I find that the HR Department have not been proactive in fostering a working environment with dignity and respect, which has ultimately allowed the bully to harass you and victimise you. Therefore, when you raise a grievance letter against a workplace colleague or manager for bullying and victimisation in the workplace, what you are really doing is pointing out the fact that the HR Department has failed to prevent the bullying, harassment, discrimination, and victimisation from occurring in the workplace. This often leads to the HR Department bullying and victimising the complainant i.e., you for daring to speak up.
Example 1 = Bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
The HR Department have failed to be proactive in promoting and championing a harmonious working environment. For the avoidance of doubt, in accordance with
s.109 of the Equality Act 2010
, your employer and the HR Department have a ‘statutory duty’ to take ‘reasonable steps’ to prevent bullying, harassment, discrimination, and victimisation in the workplace.
Example 2 = Bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
The HR Department don’t like it when you complain or raise a grievance letter for bullying, harassment, discrimination or victimisation, not least because when you complain about bullying and victimisation in the workplace, what you are really saying is that the HR Department have been crap at doing their job.
Example 3 = Bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
Thus, when you complain about bullying and victimisation in the workplace, or where you complain about feeling bullied, harassed or discriminated against by a workplace colleague or line manager, the HR Department will more often than not go into defensive mode to cover up the bullying, harassment, discrimination, and victimisation as they will not want to expose their own incompetence or laissez-faire attitude in eradicating and eliminating bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation in the workplace.
As stated above, in accordance with
s.109 of the Equality Act 2010
, your employer and the HR Department have a ‘statutory duty’ to take ‘reasonable steps’ to prevent bullying, harassment, discrimination, and victimisation at work. If your employer and the HR Department fail to take ‘reasonable steps’ to eradicate and eliminate harassment, discrimination, and victimisation in the workplace, then your employer is ‘
vicariously liable
‘ for the torts of its employees.
Lesson 1 = Bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
Therefore, when you write your grievance letter to complain about bullying and victimisation at work, remember that the HR Department are not your friends. In fact, the HR Department will more likely than not dissuade you not to complain about bullying and victimisation at work and/or attempt to steer you to deal with your complaints for bullying and victimisation informally. Why? Well, by dealing with your grievance complaint letter for workplace bully and victimisation informally, it allows the HR Department not to expose itself for its own incompetence in eradicating and eliminating such prohibited conduct in the workplace, and moreover, allows the HR Department to whitewash your grievances for bullying and victimisation without having to undertake a ‘formal investigation’.
Lesson 2 = Bullying and victimisation in the workplace:
