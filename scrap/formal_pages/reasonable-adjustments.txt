Reasonable Adjustments Equality Act 2010
Reasonable Adjustments Equality Act 2010:
Sound familiar – I cant physically do my job anymore UK.
Read on!
This web page covers reasonable adjustments at work, and your statutory rights under the auspices of The Equality Act 2010.
This page last updated 6.6.25.
Once an employer knows, (or reasonably ought to know) that you are ‘likely’ to be placed at a substantial disadvantage due to a disability or impairment, the employer is under a statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that you are not placed at a substantial disadvantage ‘because of’ your impairment or disability.
The key here is to ask yourself whether your employer is aware that you have a disability? If not, then make sure you inform the employer in your grievance letter that you have a disability/impairment. In this regard, I draw your attention to the Statutory Code of Practice on Employment 2010; Chapter 5 Paragraph 5.15:
“It is not enough for the employer to show that they did not know that the disabled person had the disability. They must also show that they could not reasonably have been expected to know about it. Employers should consider whether a worker has a disability even where one has not been formally disclosed, as, for example, not all workers who meet the definition of disability may think of themselves as a ‘disabled person’.”

Once a disability has been disclosed (preferably always in writing via email) it is incumbent upon your employer to undertake a proper assessment of your medical condition/s in consultation with you, as held in the case of
Tarbuck v Sainsburys Supermarkets Ltd
[2006] IRLR 664 at paragraphs 69 & 72:
[69] “There can be no doubt that any employer would be wise to consult with a disabled employee in order to be better informed and fully acquainted of all the factors which may be relevant to a determination of what adjustment should reasonably be made in the circumstances. If the employer fails to do that, then he is placing himself seriously at risk of not taking appropriate steps because of his own ignorance. He cannot then pray that ignorance in aid if it is alleged that he ought to have taken certain steps and he has failed to do so. The issue for the Tribunal will then be whether it was reasonable to take that step or not.”
[72] “Accordingly whilst, as we have emphasised, it will always be good practice for the employer to consult and it will potentially jeopardise the employer’s legal position if he does not do so- because the employer cannot use the lack of knowledge that would have resulted from consultation as a shield to defend a complaint that he has not made reasonable adjustments- there is no separate and distinct duty of this kind.”
List of Reasonable Adjustments Equality Act 2010:
Amy & I have outlined below a list of reasonable adjustments, which may or may not be within your employer’s size, scope and resources to make for you:
(i) A phased return to work.
(ii) A later start time.
(iii) More frequent breaks.
(iv) To work from home.
(v) To render your supervisor or manager with disability-awareness training.
(vi) To pay for counselling services.
(vii) To provide you with a quiet place of work or give you a private office space.
(viii) To provide natural light.
(ix) To provide a heater.
(x) To give you a designated seating area or office.
(xi) To disregard some or all of your disability-related sickness absence.
(xii) To allow you to eat and drink at your desk.
(xiii) To put management instructions in writing rather than verbally.
(xiv) To allow you to make a written submission in the alternative to attending a face to face meeting.
(xv) To allow you to record meetings or 1-2-1’s.
(xvi) To allow you time off from work to attend medical appointments.
The above are just a handful of adjustments, which can be made.
Amy & I can assist you in establishing the reasonable adjustments, which you need specific to your disability or impairment to assist your employer in identifying the reasonable adjustments you need under The Equality Act 2010. You can contact us on 07775943414 during working hours (9-5) or by email outside of working hours at myrightsuk@protonmail.com
