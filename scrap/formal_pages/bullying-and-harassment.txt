What is Harassment and how is it different to Bullying?
When writing a grievance letter to your employer’s HR Department you can’t say that you have been subjected to ‘unfair treatment’. You have to establish whether you have been (1) harassed; (2) bullied; (3) discriminated against. If you have been discriminated against, then you need to establish whether the treatment amounts to ‘less favourable’ treatment or ‘unfavourable’ treatment. I have written a page on
unfair treatment at work
.
The difference between harassment and bullying is easy to explain i.e. harassment is on what is called a ‘protected ground’.
A ‘protected ground’ is ‘related to’ your age, race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, religion, marriage etc, under the Equality Act 2010.
Examples of a Toxic Work Environment Unlawful Harassment:
If someone came up to you at work and said – “Debbie, you have a nice pair of tits” that would be harassment ‘related to’ your sex.
If you are black and somebody said – “you bloody n*****” that would be harassment ‘related to’ your race.
If you are old and someone said – “you are a dinosaur mate” that could potentially be harassment ‘related’ to your age.
If someone at work says – “all you Muslims are terrorists” that would be harassment ‘related to’ you religion.
Put short, if the conduct is ‘related to’ your sex, age, race, religion, etc, then it amounts to ‘harassment’.
However, if the conduct is NOT ‘related to’ your sex, sexual orientation, age, race, disability, religion, etc, then it amounts to ‘bullying’.
Bullying and harassment creates a toxic work environment and a toxic workplace.
Either way, whether you have been bullied or harassed it is what ‘you’ find to be offensive or undignified that is important. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not what your employer or its HR Department determines what is offensive to you. The Employer has to take into consideration the injury caused to ‘your’ feelings as the victim recipient. Thus, when writing a letter of grievance to the HR Department make sure you state how you felt and/or are feeling.
Bullying and Harassment can also be referred to as ‘unwanted conduct’. So, in your letter of grievance to HR you might want to say something like –
“The unwanted conduct I have been subjected to was both ‘uninvited and unwelcome. It has created a hostile, oppressive, intimidating and toxic working environment”.
For the avoidance of doubt, bullying and/or harassment does not have to be ‘related to’ you personally. If you are at work and you witness someone else bullying or harassing another person, then the law takes that into consideration that it could still cause injury to ‘your’ feelings even if you were not, per se, the victim of the bullying or harassment.
Example Harassment:
You are Asian and work with other Asians within a Department of the Company. A non-Asian person says to one of your work colleagues – “you people are all the same”. That potentially amounts to harassment ‘related to’ your race by reason that ‘you’ found the statement undignified even though it was not aimed at you personally. The Statutory Code of Practice on Employment 2011 (Chapter 7) covers harassment in more detail. It also provides other examples of harassment.
I have written a
Grievance Letter Template Aid
, which is available on this web site for only £12. The
Grievance Letter Template Aid
assists you in writing a letter of grievance to your employer’s HR Department. The Grievance Letter Template Aid covers (1) work related stress; (2) bullying and harassment (toxic work environment); (3) discrimination.
The Grievance Letter Template Aid
also covers what to say and what not to say in your grievance complaint letter to your employer. The grievance letter template also outlines what to do, and what not to do in invoking the grievance procedure and moreover in writing a grievance letter to your employer.
The Equality Act 2010 – Definition of Harassment at Work
The Equality Act 2010 defines “harassment as: “unwanted conduct” which must have the “purpose or effect” of:
“Violating the victim recipients dignity” or:-
“Creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the victim recipient”.
If you believe you have been bullied and/or harassed, then make sure that you state so in your letter of grievance to your employer’s HR Department. Equally as important, you MUST state in your letter of grievance to HR how your harasser’s “unwanted conduct” made you “feel”.  This is the most important thing you can do as ‘injury to feelings’ on the Vento Scale can payout up to £44,000 in the Employment Tribunal.
In
HM Prison Service v Salmon
, the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld an award of
£20,000 for injury to feelings
, including £5,000 aggravated damages, and a separate, undiscounted award of £15,000 for psychiatric injury, made by an employment tribunal that had partially upheld a former prison officer’s complaint of unlawful sex discrimination
Section 26 of the Equality Act 2010, is for harassment under a ‘protected characteristic’, viz: race, disability, religion, sex, sexual orientation etc,.
The incidents of bullying or harassment do not need to be connected. The harassment does not have to be by the same person either. Therefore, it is essential that within your letter of grievance that you outline how the bullying or harassment has made [you] feel.
Where your employer fails to take reasonable and practicable steps to prevent further disruption and harassment, your employer may be
vicariously liable
pursuant to s.109(1)(2)(3)(4)(a)(b) of the EqA 2010 (Equality Act 2010) –
Caniffe v East Riding of Yorkshire Council
(2000, IRLR 555, EAT).
In fact, the person whom subjects you to harassment you could be personally liable for the harassment.
Under
s.110
(1)(a)(b)(c)(2) of The EqA 2010, the individual whom harasses you can be named as an additional named respondent in civil proceedings.
Under
s.111
of The EqA 2010, a person must no ’cause, instruct or induce’ another person to harass you and/or discriminate against you. This is very important where workplace mobbing occurs.
Under
s.112
(1) of The EqA 2010, a person must not “aid” another to harass you.

Having personally been the victim recipient of bullying and harassment at work, I know first hand how it leads on to a diagnosis of work related stress, anxiety, anxiety attacks and depression being made by your GP. I know because I have already walked in your shoes, not once, not twice, but three times! This is why I have created this web-site, to assist people like you.
Sometimes people come to me whom are so down trodden by their employer that they can’t even put a grievance letter together to their employer. This is where I can help you – read my testimonials page!
Employment Tribunal – Balance of Probabilities
In truth, it is rare that an employee will have ‘evidence’ of bullying / harassment at work, to which s/he has been subjected. Harassment in the workplace is usually subtle, the harasser careful to make sure there are no witnesses to workplace bullying. Fortunately, Employment Tribunals recognise this, and take it into account. However, the burden of proof under
s.136 EqA 2010
is on [you]. Your letter of grievance to HR should outline a prima facie case against your employer, and those persons whom have subjected you to bullying, harassment and/or discrimination. A poorly written letter of grievance for bullying and harassment will be rubbished by your employer, its HR Department and the Company’s solicitors. On the other hand, a well written letter of grievance for bullying and harassment will not get rubbished! For a well written example of a grievance letter for bullying and harassment, purchase the £12 Grievance Letter Template Aid, and take back the control and the power of the person bullying / harassing you!
It is my own experience that workplace harassment occurs due to mismanagement, poor management, or weak management. Often, senior management have little resolve to confront the harasser, or more likely than not, are the harasser themselves.
In my own case I used my mobile phone to record and video my manager sexually harassing me at work. The legality of making secret recordings is covered in the Template for £16. I also asked my line manager why she acted in the manner she did towards me, and caught every word she said on my mobile telephone. Consequentially, I had hard evidence of the on-going harassment. I also got another employee to video my line manger sexually harassing me on his mobile telephone at a works do. Believe me, when it comes to harassment, a picture paints a thousand words! The upshot of the video and audio evidence was that I was able to support my letter of grievance with hard evidence. However, using your mobile is not always possible, and in these situations you could visit the Spy Shop on-line and purchase one of those ‘spy pens’. This is a great device for 1 to 1 meetings where your line manager is no longer giving you the support you need. It is also great for meetings with Human Resources in grievance and disciplinary hearings.
Unless your Company has a policy or procedure which forbids this practice, then it is fair play. I have yet to come across an employer’s policy which mentions recording meetings at all. However, be careful making covert recordings. Your employer could argue that you have breached the implied term of mutual trust and confidence by making covert recordings.
Place the Onus on your Employer
Should you chose to lodge an Employment Tribunal claim due to workplace harassment or discrimination in the workplace, the onus is on the employee to
establish facts
, that “on the balance of probabilities” what you have alleged in your ET1 [employment tribunal claim] has actually occurred. This is different to let’s say a criminal trial, whereas “beyond a reasonable doubt” has to be established.
The Employment Tribunal recognises that the employer will unlikely “concede” any liability of the alleged “torts” (wrongs). The employer will attempt to establish that the claimant’s claim does not have any “merit”. The employer will allege that your ET1 is “misconceived” throwing out as much as it can. Remember, the onus is on the employee to “shift the burden of proof “on to the employer pursuant to
s.136
of the Equality Act 2010.
Free Grievance Letter Examples
Below are two examples of a hypothetical incident of ‘sexual harassment in the workplace’. Another more in depth
letter of grievance example
germane to work related stress, harassment and disability discrimination is available at
www.formalgrievance.com
.
The first grievance example is a bad example of what to state within your letter of grievance, as it does not establish how you (the victim recipient) felt:-
“Mr Shart grabbed his crotch and told me he wanted to give me a large portion later. I was somewhat taken back, as my workplace colleagues just stood there laughing at me.”
Good grievance letter example:
“I found Shart’s conduct to be unwanted.I felt his actions were with deliberate intent, the purpose and effect to embarrass me, which is how he made me feel. I found Shart’s statement that he wanted to give me a large portion to be offensive, and most undignified. The fact that my workplace colleagues just stood there laughing at me humiliated me. Mr Shart’s conduct was wholly inappropriate. I am not sure what made him believe that his behaviour was acceptable to me. However, I felt by my colleagues laughing at me, they condoned Shart’s unwanted conduct”
In the good example above, the wording encompasses the legal definition of “harassment”. You have informed your employer that (i) you found Shart’s conduct unwanted (ii) you felt embarrassed (iii) you found Shart’s conduct to be offensive and undignified (iv) you have established the fact that you felt humiliated (v) that in no way did you encourage Shart to behave in the manner he did; Shart acted of his own volition, and of his own accord (vi) you felt your colleagues condoned Shart’s unwanted conduct by their failure to stop him.
In the good example of harassment in the workplace, you have made it difficult for your employer to point the finger of blame at you, as to do so may amount to the employer subjecting you to a “detriment” for having exercised a statutory right in lodging a letter of grievance.
Workplace Banter
However, from my own experiences, your employer will undoubtedly seek to place some portion of the blame on to you, to both limit its liability, and discredit you. It will contend that you were horsing around, and that Shart’s conduct was merely ‘harmless banter’, viz: ‘colloquial’. They may even insinuate that you in someway encouraged Shart’s behaviour, and that Shart was only reacting to you ‘egging him on’ in front of your workplace colleagues. Notwithstanding, unless you are able to ‘establish facts’ from which the Employment Tribunal could conclude that harassment has taken place, your claim is worthless. This is why it is so very important that you get your ducks in a row before you lodge your letter of grievance. (see:
grievance letter template aid
)
Webmaster’s thoughts:
When it comes to work harassment, the law is quite clear. It is what the “victim recipient” finds to be offensive, undignified, embarrassing, degrading, hostile or intimidating. It is NOTfor your employer to decide how YOU [FELT]. Each person knows what they feel is “harmless banter” and also, the behaviour which is not acceptable to them.
You need a plan of action. Gather all the evidence and facts BEFORE you lodge your grievance letter. Once the grievance procedure is invoked, your employer will appoint an investigating officer who will endeavour to limit the organisations liability. Remember, the appointed investigator is there to protect the organisation – not you! You will have no control over the appointed investigator, or the questions s/he will ask your workplace colleagues, or how that person goes about investigating what you have alleged. Keep in mind the investigator is also an employee, and will not jeopardise their own career by finding any”evidence” of harassment, which may have occurred.
So, before your invoke the grievance procedure, obtain ‘
witness statements
‘ from your colleagues where possible. You want short statements, giving the date, the time, the place, what the harasser stated, and who else was present. Get the person to sign and date their witness statement, and provide their name and address.
From my own experiences, your colleagues will put as much distance between you and them once the grievance investigation gets underway. They will not want to become embroiled in your grievance, or risk losing their own job  – forewarned is forearmed!
Legal Definition of Harassment
The legal definition of harassment under S.26 of the Equality Act 2010 is the following:
“Unwanted conduct” which must relate to one of the following “protected characteristics”:
sex
sex orientation
race
disability
age
gender
marriage and civil partnership
gender reassignment
religion.
The “unwanted conduct” must have the “purpose or effect” of:
violating the victim recipients dignity, or
creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for the victim recipient.
In truth, it is not hard to establish that the “harassment” (unwanted conduct) has “violated” your “dignity”. In nearly every case of “harassment” it will be viewed by the victim as having been, or had the “effect of” either being “degrading, humiliating, offensive or hostile”. The key is that you MUST tie the harassment in to one of the aforementioned “protected characteristics”.
For what it is worth, pursuant to s.110(a)(b)(c)(2) of the Equality Act 2010, the harasser can be held personally liable for their own conduct in harssing you. Within your letter of grievance, I would inform your employer that they need to warn your harasser in writing to desist harassing you further; otherwise the Company would leave you no choice but to name your harasser as an additional named respondent in any Employment Tribunal proceedings. This usually puts the fear of God into the employer and the harasser, as the last thing the employer wants is to be held vicariously liable for the harassment pursuant to s.109(1)(2)(3)(4)(a)(b) of the Equality Act 2010.
Moreover, if the employer fails to take reasonable steps to prevent others employees’ from harassing you (google workplace mobbing) then the employer could be liable for inducing, causing, and aiding contraventions pursuant to s.111 of the Equality Act 2010. If you need a custom letter of grievance drafting to your employer, then contact me. There is nothing like a bit of law and a few case precedents quoted within your letter of grievance to bring your harasser to their senses!

If you believe that you have been “harassed” due to having a disability, then click

: You may be surprised as to what legally constitutes having a “disability”. I strongly suggest you read this section, as you may have a disability, which you were unaware is a legally recognised as a disability. The following are
