Coronavirus Work Grievance Letter:
Coronavirus (Covid-19) Safe System of Work:
NHS Staff & Other Staff exposed to Coronavirus at Work:
Are you concerned about going to work because of Coronavirus?
Do you fear going to work because you may catch Coronavirus?
Is your employer failing to ensure a ‘safe system of work’ for you because of your exposure to Coronavirus in the work environment?
Is your employer failing to observe a ‘duty of care’ for your health, safety and welfare at work because of your exposure to Coronavirus at work?
Do you have an underlying health condition, which means your health, safety and welfare at work could be put at risk of harm because of Coronavirus at work?
Are you pregnant?
Your Work Rights Coronavirus:
In accordance with s.1(1)(a) of The HSAWA 1974, your employer is
statutory obliged
to observe a statutory ‘duty of care’ for your
health, safety and welfare at work.
Moreover, in accordance with s.2(1)(2)(a)(e) of The HSAWA 1974, your employer is
statutory obliged
to render you with
‘a safe system of work’
.
Thus, if your employer has failed, is failing and/or is likely going to fail to (1) observe a duty of care for your health, safety and/or welfare at work; (2) render you with a safe system of work, this is the Employment Law which protects you:
Coronavirus – Your Employment Rights:
In accordance with s.7 of The HSAWA 1974, all employees are
statutory obliged
to take ‘reasonable care’ for their
own
health, safety and welfare at work.
This means that you have a ‘legal duty’ to ensure your own health safety and welfare at work.
Example: Let’s say you are asthmatic and/or are pregnant and work in a call center where multiple people work in one room, and you are worried about being exposed to Coronavirus because you have an underlying medical condition / pregnancy, you would be within your statutory rights to refuse to come to work (or any dangerous part) of your workplace whilst that ‘danger’ exists.
Moreover, in accordance with s.44(1)(d)(e) of The ERA 1996, you can
lawfully refuse to attend work
if you ‘reasonably believe’ that the working environment
“endangers”
your health, safety and/or welfare at work –
“In circumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent and which he could not reasonably have been expected to avert, he left (or proposed to leave)
or (while the danger persisted) refused to return to his place of work or any dangerous part of his place of work
, or”
in circumstances of danger which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent
, he took (or proposed to take) appropriate steps to protect himself
or other persons from the danger.”
Thus, if you ‘reasonably believe’ that in attending work and/or being at work, that it could (or would) likely lead to you becoming infected with Coronavirus, then contact us to assist you in raising a letter of grievance to assert your statutory right on grounds of health and safety.
