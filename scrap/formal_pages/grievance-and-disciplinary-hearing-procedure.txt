If you want to know
how to win a grievance meeting
or disciplinary hearing, then we have written the ‘Grievance and Disciplinary Hearing Template’, which is an ‘aid’ in assisting you to prepare for (and take steps for) attending either a disciplinary hearing or attending a grievance meeting with your employer.
Covert Recordings in the Workplace UK:
Okay, are you thinking of making a covert recording of a
workplace investigatory meeting
or covertly recording a disciplinary meeting?
The grievance and disciplinary template below (£16) outlines the pros and cons of making covert recordings at workplace meetings, whether the meeting is disciplinary, grievance, performance, capability, suspension or a sickness absence meeting.
The Grievance & Disciplinary Hearing Template also includes case law, whereas the Employment Appeal Tribunal recognises that covert recordings (whilst distasteful) are sometimes a necessary ‘evil’.
Thus, if you want to know whether or not it is illegal to make a workplace covert recording, or whether a secret or covert recording can be used as evidence in the Employment Tribunal here in the UK, or whether you can record a meeting without consent, the ‘Grievance and Disciplinary Hearing Template’ (below) covers these topics.
The Grievance and Disciplinary Procedure Hearing Template also discusses the pros and cons of having “without prejudice” conversations with your employer in order to reach a settlement agreement. So, if you need help in preparing to attend a workplace meeting, and want to know what you should say (and not to say), then buy the template.
The Following Applies
For the avoidance of any doubt, (based on what Amy & I have seen to date) the employers HR Department are not impartial. The apparent bias of the HR Department towards protecting your employer, (which for the avoidance of doubt, is the HR Departments job), divests you of obtaining effective remedy and redress to your grievances. It may also divest you of having a fair and equitable grievance or disciplinary procedure hearing / meeting.
Attending a
workplace investigatory meeting
can be a nerve racking experience, as more likely than not you are already having ruminating thoughts about attending a workplace grievance meeting, disciplinary, capability, performance, or sickness absence meeting without knowing your employee rights UK.
As such, my wife Amy & I have created this template to assist you in the taking the steps, which you need to take when attending a grievance, disciplinary, capability, performance, suspension, or sickness absence meeting.
The Grievance & Disciplinary Template is an ‘aid’ to assist and guide you, so that you are better prepared for attending workplace investigatory meetings, and furthermore, have some options in the likely event your employer acts in a capricious or egregious manner during the sickness absence, capability, performance, grievance, disciplinary or suspension meeting.
The fact is, by purchasing the Grievance ad Disciplinary Hearing Procedure Template Aid above for £16, you will be better prepared what to say and what not to say.
Much like the Grievance Letter Template Aid, the Grievance and Disciplinary Hearing Procedure Template above is to aid and assist you to make informed decisions and to understand the do’s and don’ts, including what to say, and what not to say.
Don’t fall foul of a heavy handed employer! Buy the Template NOW and alleviate the fears of your employer’s HR Department getting the upper hand on you during the grievance, disciplinary, capability, performance, or sickness absence meeting.
