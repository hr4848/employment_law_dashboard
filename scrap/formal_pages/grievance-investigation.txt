How to win a grievance hearing as an employee:
Your employer will inevitably invite you to a grievance meeting to discuss the letter of grievance, which you have submitted for bullying, harassment, discrimination in accordance with the ACAS Code. More often than not, you will be invited to attend a grievance meeting.
The grievance procedures are like a game of snakes and ladders. What you need to do is go up the ladders and let your employer come down the snakes. Amy & I can assist you with this. There is definitely a psychological aspect germane to the grievance procedures, and therefore, it is important for
you to be in control
of your letter of grievance when attending the grievance hearing or grievance meeting. Amy & I will assist you and guide you through the grievance process and give you the best possible chance of success hopefully without the need to litigate. Put shortly, it is in the best interests of all our clients not to refer to the Employment Tribunal, not least as of July 2023, there is still a large backlog of claims in the Employment Tribunal.
Thus, you get one chance to get the grievance hearing right, and Amy & I are here to assist you to do just that!
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Take Control:
The first step is to take control of the grievance process. Don’t be a lap dog when attending the grievance meeting or grievance hearing . This is the mistake that most employees make insofar that the employee allows the employer to dictate the grievance hearing / grievance meeting.
As such, if you are signed off from work as unfit to work by your GP, you may want to propose asking your employer (via email) to make a reasonable adjustment to undertake the grievance procedures via written form in the alternative to attending a face-to-face grievance meeting. You need to slow the grievance procedures down. The most common mistake, which people make, is to rush through the grievance procedures. You want to take the pressure off yourself and ameliorate the stress and anxiety which you are feeling in order to see the wood for the trees. Amy & I realise that being too emotionally involved can often lead to a letter of grievance being a rant. We are here to help you and guide you to get the best possible outcome by formulating your letter of grievance to the breaches of your statutory rights.
You also need to be able to objectively put forth your case, and furthermore, answer any questions, without being caught like a rabbit in the headlights of a car at the grievance meeting or grievance hearing. Most of our clients who raise a letter of grievance for bullying, harassment and discrimination are more often than not suffering from symptoms of anxiety and depression. Thus, the last thing you want to do is to put yourself on the spot and not be able to express yourself during the course of the grievance meeting. It is all too easy to become tongue tied and emotional when discussing grievances for bullying, harassment and discrimination.
Therefore, Amy & I would always suggest that wherever possible you do not attend a grievance meeting / grievance hearing to discuss your letter of grievance. It is far better to have everything done in written form so that there is an accurate record of what was said, and furthermore, who said it. Notwithstanding, nine times out of ten, the minutes of the grievance meeting / grievance hearing will never be a true and accurate reflection of what has been stated during the grievance investigatory meeting/ grievance hearing. It is common practice for the HR Department to remove statements, which the aggrieved employee has made, especially where the grievances are for bullying, harassment and discrimination. The employer will want to mitigate its liability. In my wife’s case, Amy’s employer was responsible for putting together the bundle of documents for the employment tribunal. It was whilst reading through the bundle of documents, that we discovered that huge tranches of Amy’s grievance letter had been deliberately removed. Luckily, as Amy had emailed her grievance letters (plural) to the HR Department, we were able to demonstrate to the Employment Tribunal that Amy’s employer had acted in bad faith by seeking to pervert the natural justice, and moreover, had acted in an egregious manner by changing what Amy had actually written within her letter of grievance. Thus, do not under estimate the skullduggery of the HR Department or your employer’s legal department.
Grievance Procedure Emails:
Make sure all your correspondence with your employer is via email. This way, in the event that matters do escalate to the employment tribunal, you will have proof of the date and time you sent your emails, and furthermore, what was said (and who it was said to). A picture paints a thousand words.
Another mistake that a lot of people make when raising grievances for bullying. harassment and discrimination is to communicate with their employer via the telephone. In our opinion this is a massive mistake, not least as in the event you do end up going to the employment tribunal you will have no evidence of what was said or what was said back to you. Very often, the grievance procedures can become heated because tensions are running high.
Thus, if you are communicating with your employer via a work email address, we would suggest that you consider taking a photograph or screen shot of any emails, which are sent and received. This is particularly important because sometimes when employees raise a letter of grievance for bullying and harassment and have been signed off from work as unfit to work, the employer will very often remove your access to work emails. Think ahead!
Put shortly, the employer will do everything within its means to prevent you obtaining evidence to support your position and/or give you an opportunity to provide any evidence to support your grievances for bullying, harassment, discrimination, in the event the matters escalate to the employment tribunal.
However, you must be ‘extremely careful’ when making copies of work emails. Previously, we have had clients who have raised grievances for bullying. harassment, discrimination and have printed off emails and/or have sent work emails to their private email address at home. These employees’ have then been suspended and subjected to a disciplinary investigation for breaching the employer’s IT policy and procedures.
To this end, Amy & I would strongly recommend reading through your employer’s IT policy
prior
to raising a grievance for bullying and harassment so that you can be better informed of your employer’s procedures. Again, we are here to help as a reasonable cost of £50 per hour.
Another reason why an employer will very often
suspend
you and prohibit you from contacting workplace colleagues, is to stop you from gathering evidence and obtaining witness statements to support your letter of grievance or grievance complaint letter for bullying and harassment. Remember, the HR Department are there to protect the interests of your employer, NOT you!
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – The Investigating Officer:
The grievance investigation and outcome will only be as good as the appointed grievance investigating officer.
Therefore, in your letter of grievance, we would stipulate to your employer that it is incumbent upon them to appoint a ‘competent person’ to undertake the grievance investigation into your grievances for bullying, harassment, discrimination and work-related stress.
The failure to appoint a competent person to undertake the grievance investigation could potentially amount to a fundamental breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, which could allow you to claim
constructive unfair dismissal
. However, it is incumbent upon you to take legal advice before doing so. Amy & I are not solicitors and so cannot give you ‘advice’.
Once your employer has appointed an investigating officer, we would be inclined to ask how many grievances for bullying, harassment and/or discrimination that particular investigating officer has previously investigated, and furthermore, how many of the grievance investigations for bullying and harassment and discrimination were upheld by that particular investigating officer.
You have every right to know the competency of the appointed investigating officer who is investigating your letter of grievance. Don’t get fobbed off by the HR Department stating that the appointed investigating officer is a competent person without providing the evidence or facts to support that s/he is a ‘competent person’.
The key here is not to appear to be disruptive, but to genuinely ensure that your employer has appointed a ‘competent person’ to undertake the investigation into your letter of grievance for bullying, harassment, discrimination and work-related stress. This way, if the grievance investigation and grievance outcome letter are a complete whitewash, (which they will be), you can then argue that the appointed investigating officer was not a ‘competent person’ and that the HR Department stating that the appointed investigating officer was a competent person, was (and is) a very serious breach of the implied term of
mutual trust and confidence
.
If the HR Department have previously been involved (but have failed to act with diligence or competence), you may want to suggest inviting a neutral and independent third-party HR organisation to undertake the investigation into your letter of grievance for bullying and harassment, especially if you believe that your employer’s HR Department could prejudice the grievance investigation with bias and/or ‘materially influenced’ the grievance outcome. See
Ramphal v Department for Transport
UKEAT/0352/14/DA.
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Evidence:
If you are signed off from work as unfit to work during the grievance investigation and have asked for your grievances to be dealt with by written form, which Amy & I would suggest, then your employer may want to ascertain your fitness to attend a grievance meeting.
We would point out to you that your own doctor’s ‘duty of care’ is to you. However, the employers’ occupational health advisors / doctors’ duty of care is
not
to you, but rather to your employer. See
Kapfunde v Abbey National and Daniel
[1998] IRLR 583 (CA).
Therefore, we would suggest that if you are unfit to attend a grievance meeting or grievance hearing to discuss your letter of grievance, that you obtain a letter from your GP (even if you have to pay for it), which letter should outline the ‘substantial adverse effects’ which your work related stressors are having on your ‘day to day activities’, and furthermore, how attending a grievance meeting in person (whether by video link or by telephone) would put you at a disadvantage because of something arising in consequence of your current state of mental health.
If you have any underlying medical conditions such as asthma, anxiety, migraines, thyroid, or diabetes, you want to outline this fact in writing to your employer (via email), by reason that all the above conditions are exacerbated by stress. Therefore, your employer would not be observing a statutory ‘duty of care’ for your health, safety, and welfare at work by putting you under excessive pressure and duress to attend a grievance meeting or grievance hearing knowing it would have a substantial adverse effect upon your health. Potentially, this could give rise to a claim for disability discrimination.
Be warned of attending occupational health assessments. More often than not an employer will utilise the services of an occupational health organisation which will favour the employers’ position, rather than your position. We are not saying that occupational health are suborned to their paymaster. However, what we are saying is that it is not uncommon for an employer to work with an occupational health organisation who is ‘favourable to them’.
If your employer insists on you seeing occupational health to assess your ability to attend a grievance meeting or grievance hearing, then get in contact with us. For the avoidance of doubt, the employer should except what the employee states at face value, and should not without reasonable cause be seeking to obtain a medical report by reason that this could infringe on your right to privacy under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Statutory Timeframes:
So, the moral to the story is don’t rush through the grievance procedures. It is far better to take these matters one step at a time and do it right first-time round. That said, do not allow your employer to wilfully run you outside of your statutory time limits to bring any claims in the employment tribunal, as most claims for harassment and discrimination will be time barred after three months less one day. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to ensure that your employer is not dragging out the grievance procedures to wilfully run you outside of the employment tribunal’s jurisdiction to bring any claims under s.123 of The Equality Act 2010. Forewarned is forearmed!
If you get the feeling that your employer is deliberately seeking to run you outside of the employment tribunals time limits, which employers often do, then you may want to consider commencing pre-claim conciliation with ACAS in accordance with s.7 of The ERRA 2013, to preserve your statutory timeframes.
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Grievance Investigation:
Prior to COVID-19 reaping havoc upon mankind, I attended employment seminars for HR representatives and solicitors run by leading barristers to assist HR representatives and solicitors in dealing with employees’ grievances. A common trait now, is that the employer will more often than not seek to send you a list of questions in relation to the grievances, which you have raised in advance of the grievance hearing. The key here, in answering these questions, is that you do not answer the questions in a way which could be later used against you, because no doubt, this will be used against you if you end up going to the employment tribunal.
You may be asked a question like – “do you agree that Johns behaviour was just merely banter?”
Another question might be “do you agree that you participated in the conversation which you are now complaining about as having been bullied and harassed?”
Don’t waffle when answering these sorts of questions. If you need assistance in putting your letter of grievance together and/or going through the grievance procedures, then please feel free to reach out to Amy & I to assist you in
not
making the mistakes, which we commonly see being made.
Reach out to us at: myrightsuk@protonmail.com or call during working hours 9-5 on 07775943414.
We charge £35 for an initial telephone consultation (up to one hour) and £50 an hour thereafter, or any part hour thereof.
It is better to get us on board in advance of submitting your letter of grievance so that we can run you through what is going to happen during the grievance meeting or grievance hearing so you can watch out for the traps and snares, which your employer will undoubtedly lay for you to walk into. This is so that if you do end up bringing claims in the employment tribunal, that your employer will use your own words against you in what you have written or answered. For the avoidance of doubt, you can lose a tribunal case on one word. Thus, it is imperative that you get your letter of grievance right from the get-go.
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Grievance Outcome:
We can almost guarantee it, that an employer will never concede any liability for harassment or discrimination. To do so would leave the employer wide open to claims in the employment tribunal. As such, your employer will go through some form of legal chicanery in order to mitigate any liability for harassment and discrimination. The most common outcome we see when reading grievance outcome letters from employers, is they say that there is “no evidence” of harassment having occurred. Of course, unless you are very fortunate to have actual hard evidence of harassment having occurred, then it will be difficult to ‘
shift the burden of proof
‘’.
99.99 % of the time, when investigating your grievances for either bullying or harassment, your employer will never ask you ‘your perception’ of the bullying and harassment, which you have been subjected to.
Therefore, if your employer did not undertake an ‘objective finding’ of ‘your subjective feelings’ when investigating your grievances for bullying and harassment, then part and parcel of your grounds of appeal will be to outline case law to support your position, viz: that it is little wonder that your employer did not find any “evidence” of bullying and harassment having occurred, not least by reason that your employer never bothered to ask you ‘your perception’ of the bullying and harassment, as the ‘complainant’.
For example, in the case authority of
Chawla v Hewlett Packard Ltd
UKEAT/0280/13/BA (paragraph 77), the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that the first step when investigating a complaint for ‘harassment’ should be to take into consideration the ‘perception’ of the complainant, and furthermore, to undertake an objective finding of your subjective feelings –
“Whilst the perception of the Claimant, the first element in section 26(4), requires an ‘objective’ finding of the Claimant’s ‘subjective’ feelings about the act complained of, the elements in section 26(4)(b) and (c) require an objective assessment by the ET.”
In this regard, we draw your attention to paragraphs 75 to 77 of
Chawla v Hewlett Packard Ltd
UKEAT/0280/13/BA, whereas the Employment Appeal Tribunal made the following observations –
“Consideration of whether the perception of the Claimant is reasonable is now a mandatory element of the decision under EqA section 26(4) whether the unwanted conduct has the effect referred to in section 26(1)(b). Underhill J held at paragraph 15 that:
“Overall the criterion is objective because what the tribunal is required to consider is whether, if the Claimant has experienced those feelings or perceptions, it was reasonable for her to do so – whether it was reasonable for a claimant to have felt her dignity to have been violated is quintessentially a matter for the factual assessment of the tribunal. It will be important for it to have regard to all the relevant circumstances, including the context of the conduct in question.”
One of the elements referred to by Underhill J in the context of whether it was reasonable for the conduct complained of to have the proscribed effect was “whether the conduct was, or was not, intended to cause offence (or, more precisely, to produce the proscribed consequences): the same remark may have a very different weight if it was evidently innocently intended that if it was evidently intended to hurt …”. Underhill J considered that where they are not apparent, the grounds for an act have to be sought by considering the Respondent’s motivation (not motive).
Whilst the perception of the Claimant, the first element in section 26(4), requires an objective finding of the Claimant’s subjective feelings about the act complained of, the elements in section 26(4)(b) and (c) require an objective assessment by the ET. Having examined the evidence, the ET found that Ms Mauga was “trying to be helpful” to the Claimant. On a fair reading of paragraph 56 and in context, the word motive is used in the sense of intention. As Underhill J held in Richmond Pharmacology, the context of the conduct and whether the conduct, in this case the emails, was intended to produce the proscribed consequences are material to the decision of the ET whether it was reasonable for the conduct complained of to have the effect relied upon.”
How to win a grievance hearing as an employee – Appeal Process:
