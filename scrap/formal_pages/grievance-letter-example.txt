Are you looking to raise a grievance complaint letter (letter of grievance) against a supervisor, workplace colleague or manager for unfair treatment at work, bullying, harassment or discrimination? Then read on!
Compliance with ACAS Code
:
Before you lodge your letter of grievance to enter the grievance procedure, give yourself a quick lesson in employment law to know your employment rights UK. As of April 6
th
2014, you cannot lodge a claim in the Employment Tribunal until ACAS has been given a chance to conciliate between you and your employer to attempt to obviate the litigative route. Thus, I cannot understate the importance of getting your letter of grievance right. Spending an hour or so reading through the pages of
www.formalgrievance.com
will help you to accomplish this. In turn, this will provide you with a fighting chance against both your employer, and your employer’s solicitors.
Employees’ who lodge a grievance complaint letter to the HR Department to enter the grievance procedure will very likely end up referring to the Employment Tribunal in order to obtain ‘effective remedy and redress’ to their grievances. This is due to the fact that an employer will unlikely admit any liability for harassment/discrimination, which would make the employer liable to pay you compensation. The Employment Tribunal also places the
burden of proof
on the employee (claimant) to establish that you have been subjected to either harassment and/or discrimination. Consequentially, under s.136 of the Equality Act 2010 it is on you to shift the
burden of proof
upon your employer, and moreover that what you say happened, actually happened.
What this means in plain English is that you have to be able to demonstrate to the Employment Tribunal that you have been *subjected to harassment and/or discrimination. Your employer knows this, and will use this against you during the grievance procedure/investigation.
*For the avoidance of doubt, to furnish your employer with actual ‘evidence’ of bullying, harassment or discrimination is not necessary when writing your letter of grievance, albeit your employer will likely ask you to facilitate ‘evidence’ that bullying, harassment and/or discrimination has taken place.
Note: it is rare that an employee will ever have ‘actual evidence’ of bullying, harassment/discrimination. However, we have created a
grievance letter template
on how to gather evidence before submitting your letter of grievance.
Therefore, the employee grievance complaint letter, which you send to the HR Department needs to accomplish three things:
Firstly, the employee grievance letter needs to bring to the HR Departments attention its (i) acts (ii) omissions, and (iii) breaches of statutory duties under UK employment laws. Furthermore, where possible, which Statutory Acts or Regulations your employer has contravened. These Employment Acts and Regulations are already encompassed within the
Grievance Letter Template Aid
which can be purchased for only £12.
Secondly, the letter of grievance which you write to your employer’s HR Department ought to outline a short chronology to highlight the facts germane to your grievances, viz: the what, the who, the where, and the when.  If you need some help drafting a grievance letter, then click
here
Thirdly, you should ask questions in your letter of grievance. In June 2022, ACAS have endorsed
submitting questions
to an aggrieved party’s employer in order to obtain answers to their grievances. ACAS have provided clear
advice
of how an employer should go about answering an aggrieved employee’s questions. If your employer omits to answer your questions outlined within your letter of grievance, the employment tribunal can draw an ‘adverse inference’. In this regard, I draw your attention to the authority of
Dattani v Chief Constable of West Mercia Police
[2005] IRLR 327:
“A respondent, asked a direct question in writing by an aggrieved person, who fails to respond, or does so evasively, ought to be treated in the same way irrespective of whether a question has been asked under the statutory procedure.”
Grievance Complaint Letter Template Bullying & Harassment:
.
In the free grievance complaint letter example below, I am establishing facts whereas workplace stress caused by excessive workload and workplace bullying and harassment which triggered an employee’s disability (usually panic attacks and depression). Being bullied and harassed at work creates a toxic work environment. Being bullied and harassed at work creates a toxic workplace in which to communicate with your line manager, supervisor, and workplace colleagues. Both Amy & I were subjected to a hostile, oppressive, and toxic work environment due to bullying and harassment by our line managers. Thus, we know first hand the stress and anxiety, which you feel. These personal experiences makes us better able to assist you.
The employee grievance letter example below places the burden on the employer to “remedy the breach”. As an employee you want to keep your statements within your grievance letter short – preferably in bullet points with sub-headings (don’t ramble).
In invoking the grievance procedure and grievance process you want to write as much as you need to the HR Department in order to establish the ‘facts’ of your case. This requires the employee to put their grievances in some order of semblance within the grievance letter, whereas a reasonable person of a reasonable mind can articulate what your grievances are germane to.
At the end of this grievance letter example, I have included a breakdown of each paragraph in relation to the hypothetical employer’s failures (breaches of duty).
You can purchase a
grievance letter template
which is pre written by Sam Stone. All you have to do is fill in the blanks where indicated. This grievance letter template includes employment law and legal terminology germane to all of the following grievances:
work related stress.
bullying and harassment.
discrimination.
health and safety.
The grievance letter template aid is good value for money, and tells you the do’s and don’ts of writing a letter of grievance to enter the grievance procedure at work.
Under the
Defamation Act 2013
, the last thing you want is your employer holding you personally liable for making statements of a defamatory nature about either your employer, or its employees’. In accordance with
s.2(1) of the Defamation Act 2013
, it is a defence to an action for defamation for (you) to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of within your letter of grievance is substantially true.
As such, you cannot afford to get your letter of grievance wrong! You don’t want to make allegations against workplace colleagues and risk being sued for libel.
Free Grievance Letter Example – How to write a letter of grievance:
[anything in parenthesis is legal terminology]
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am lodging a grievance letter to invoke the grievance procedure, due to a ‘reasonable belief’ that (organisations name) has breached its ‘statutory duties’ germane to ‘health and safety’ within the workplace.
In so doing, I am asking (organisations name) to observe the implied term of ‘mutual trust and confidence’, and ‘not act in a manner which would likely destroy, or further seriously damage that trust and confidence’. I trust therefore, that (organisations name) will observe the ‘good faith performance’ and take ‘reasonable and practicable steps’ to remedy the following breaches with immediate effect.
I contend (organisations name) has failed to provide my person with a ‘safe system of work’. This omission is a contravention of my employer’s statutory duties under the auspices of The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, The Management Of Health And Safety At Work Regulations 1999, The Employment Rights Act 1996, and the Equality Act 2010. These omissions are outlined in the following paragraphs.
1. Breach of Duty of Care – Equality Act 2010 – Disability Discrimination
I have consulted my doctor and discussed with him the fact, that the combination of excessive workload and workplace harassment has exacerbated my asthma, triggering my having asthma attacks. This has meant that I have had to medicate more frequently. As a consequence of such, the excessive use of my inhalers is having a ‘detrimental’ effect upon my physical and psychological health and wellbeing, inducing both rapid heart beat and heart palpitations. The ‘cumulative effects’ of the aforementioned have ‘adversely affected’ my ‘abilities and capabilities’ to undertake my ‘day-to-day activities’. This impedes both my ‘mobility and concentration’ within the working environment. I am asking that (organisations name) make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to accommodate my disability, and acts with ‘due diligence’ to remedy the situation.
2. Breach of Duty of Care – Equality Act 2010 – Harassment
I feel I have needlessly been subjected to a ‘systematic campaign’ of harassment, due to (organisations names) omissions to take ‘reasonable and practicable steps’ and/or to implement any ‘preventative or protective measures’ to ensure a working environment free from bullying and harassment. I wish to bring to the ‘directorships attention their fiduciary duties’ with express particular the fact, that it is the directorship who are legally responsible to champion, promote, communicate, and implement (organisations names) policies and procedures down the chain of command to their ‘ordinary employees’. In this regard, I draw my employer’s attention to the
HSE e-Bulletin INDG 417
. Notwithstanding, neither myself nor my work colleagues have been involved in any workplace training (or stress audits) germane to health and safety within the preceding ?twelve? months. Such an omission speaks volumes in itself. Perchance, I would not now find myself in this position, had (organisations name) been proactive in conveying it policies and procedures germane to harassment and equalities.
Furthermore, this omission has created an ‘oppressive and intimidating’ working environment for my person. I can no longer ignore the ‘palpable risk of harm’ Mr. Shart’s ‘unwanted conduct’ has had (and is having) upon my physical and psychological health and wellbeing, which is prejudicial to my health, safety and welfare at work. This information is disclosed as an assertion of a statutory right in accordance with
s.44(1)(c) of The ERA 1996
:
“He brought to his employer’s attention, by reasonable means, circumstances connected with his work which he reasonably believed were harmful or potentially harmful to health or safety”
I personally find Mr. Shart’s ‘unwanted conduct’ abhorrent; it is undignified, embarrassing and degrading. I am having sleepless nights and night sweats whilst wondering what the next day might bring. This has unnecessarily caused anxiety, nervousness and distress. Due to a lack of sleep, I often go about my duties in a state of autonomy or zombiefied state; this is hardly conducive to a ‘safe working environment’.
Go on to outline the date, time and place where the harassment / discrimination took place, and any witnesses whom were present at the material time/s
3. Breach of Duty of Care – Employment Rights Act 1996 – Workplace Danger
It is my contention that Mr Shart’s ‘unpredictable behaviour’ poses a palpable ‘danger’ to both myself (and others) within the working environment. As such, a ‘foreseeable risk of harm’ exists to both my mental and physical health. Therefore, I am asking (organisations name) to observe the Equality Human Rights Commission guidelines, and suspend Mr Shart due to the aforementioned reasons. Notwithstanding, I contend that a failure to do so may make (organisations name) ‘vicariously liable’ for any subsequent ‘omission to act’ to prevent further detriments from being inflicted upon my person. For the record, I can no longer work with Mr Shart. This is due to the very fact, that his ‘unwanted conduct’ has a ‘detrimental effect’ on my health’. As such, I ask that you consider the ‘magnitude of the risk of harm occurring, and the gravity of the harm which may occur’should management ‘refuse this request’.
It is my hope that in invoking the grievance procedure, I will not be made a workplace pariah, and or subjected to any ‘detriment’ or ‘detrimental treatment’ which would amount to a contravention of the aforementioned Acts or Regulations. I trust my career can continue to flourish under more positive circumstances, and look forward to pursuing my career with (organisations name).
Yours sincerely,

The Law Respective To The Wording Within This Letter of Grievance
Introduction:
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am lodging a grievance letter to invoke the grievance procedure, due to ‘my belief’ that (organisations name) has breached its ‘statutory duties’ germane to ‘health and safety’ within the working environment.
In so doing, I am asking (organisations name) to observe the implied term of ‘mutual trust and confidence’, and ‘not act in a manner which would likely destroy, or seriously damage’ that trust and confidence’. I trust therefore, that (organisations name) will observe the ‘good faith performance’, and take ‘reasonable and practicable steps’ to remedy the following breaches with immediate effect.
I contend (organisations name) has ‘failed to provide’ my person with a ‘safe place or system of work’. This may amount to a contravention of its statutory duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, The Management Of Health And Safety At Work Regulations 1999, The Employment Rights Act 1996, and the Equality Act 2010. These omissions are outlined in the following paragraphs.
You are putting your employer on notice that it may potentially have:
Breached your contract of employment, by its failure to observe the organisations own
contractually binding policies
,
Failed to observe the organisations “statutory duties” to provide you with a “
safe place or system of work
“,
Failed to observe the “
mutual trust and confidence
” (breach of “duty of care”)
Placed on notice you expect your employer to act in “good faith” and observe the “
good faith performance
“,
Placed on notice you expect your employer to take “
reasonable and practicable steps
” to ensure your “health and safety at work”.
First Paragraph:
You have ‘identified’ to your employer that a “foreseeable risk of harm” exists to your “health”. It is incumbent upon your employer to make “reasonable adjustments” and take “reasonable and practicable steps” to “protect” your “health” from any potential “risk of harm”.
1. Breach of Duty of Care – Equality Act 2010 – Disability Discrimination
I have consulted my doctor and discussed with him the fact, that the combination of excessive workload and workplace harassment have exacerbated my asthma, triggering my having asthma attacks. This has meant that I have had to medicate more frequently. ‘As a consequence of such’, the excessive use of my inhalers is having a ‘detrimental impact’ upon my health, inducing both rapid heart beat and heart palpitations. The ‘cumulative effects’ of the aforementioned have ‘adversely affected’ my ‘abilities and capabilities’ to undertake my ‘day-to-day activities’. This impedes both my ‘mobility and concentration’ within the working environment. I am asking that (organisations name) make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to accommodate my disability, and acts with ‘due diligence’ to remedy the situation.
You have established the following facts:
1. You have consulted your doctor, and placed information on your medical records – “medical evidence” of “
impending harm to health
”
2. you have a lawfully recognised impairment (
disability
) – “foreseeable risk of harm” to “health”
3. you employer is legally obligated to make  – “
reasonable adjustments
” for your person
4. you have identified the “triggers” for your disability – “causation” – ‘excessive workload” and “harassment’
5. the “triggers” for your “disability” have led to you taking medication more frequently – “detrimental impact” – “risk of harm”
6. you are having asthma attacks more often – “
gravity of harm
”
7. habitual abuse of your inhalers is having a “detrimental impact” upon your health – “prejudicial to health”
8. this impedes your ‘day to day activities’ – “mobility/concentration” within the “working environment” – potential “risk of harm” and or “danger”
9. your “
abilities and capabilities
” to undertake and perform your job role are being impeded. See the page on “
Workplace Stress
”
10. you are placing the onus on your employer to act with “
due diligence
“.
Second Paragraph:
State how being harassed has made you ‘feel’. This is very, very important. I cannot understate this point.
2. Breach of Duty of Care – Equality Act 2010 – Harassment
I feel I have needlessly been subjected to a ‘systematic campaign’ of harassment, due to (organisations names) omission/s to undertake any ‘preventative or protective measures’ to ensure a working environment free from harassment. I wish to bring to the ‘directorships attention their fiduciary duties’, with express particular the fact, that it is the directorship who are legally responsible to champion, promote, communicate, and implement (organisations names) policies and procedures down the chain of command to their ‘ordinary employees’. Notwithstanding, neither myself nor my work colleagues have been involved in any workplace training (or stress audits) germane to health and safety within the preceding ?twelve? months. Such an omission speaks volumes in itself. Perchance, I would not now find myself in this position, had (organisations name) been proactive in conveying it policies and procedures germane to harassment and equalities.
Furthermore, this omission has created an ‘oppressive and intimidating’ working environment for my person. I can no longer ignore the ‘palpable risk of harm’ Mr. Shart’s ‘unwanted conduct’ has had upon my ‘mental and physical health’, both of which are ‘materially injurious’. I personally find Mr. Shart’s ‘unwanted conduct’ abhorrent; it is undignified, embarrassing and degrading. I am having sleepless nights and night sweats whilst wondering what the next day might bring. This has unnecessarily caused anxiety, nervousness and distress. Due to a lack of sleep, I often go about my duties in a state of autonomy or ‘zombiefied state’; this is hardly conducive to a safe working environment.
1. your employer has failed to communicate its policies,
2. the directorship have failed to observe their “
fiduciary duties
”
3. failed to observe Regulation 13(2) of The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (MHSAWR 1999)- “Every employer shall ‘ensure’ that his employees are provided with adequate health and safety training”
4. failed to observe Section 2(1) & (2c) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSAWA 1974) – “It shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; including the provision of such information, instruction, training and supervision as is necessary to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable,thehealth and safety at work of his employees.”
5. you have established that Mr. Shart’s “unwanted conduct” is having a “detrimental impact” upon both your “mental and physical health”
6. you have used all the ‘buzz words’ which legally define “
harassment
” under the Equality Act 2010
7. you have made clear how the harassment has made you “feel” viz: “undignified, embarrassing and degrading”.
Beadles Group Ltd -v- Angelica Graham: The employer had no written policy on either sex harassment or equal opportunities, and had failed to provide ‘training or advice’ to ‘ordinary employees’ about sexual harassment, or warn them against it. Ms Graham was awarded £180,000 having worked for just one week as a trainee sales person. (see
case law
)
Third Paragraph:
3. Breach of Duty of Care – Employment Rights Act 1996 – Danger
It is my contention that Mr Shart’s ‘unpredictable behaviour’ poses a palpable ‘danger’ to both myself (and others) within the working environment. As such, a ‘foreseeable risk of harm’ exists to both my mental and physical health. Therefore, I am asking (organisations name) to observe the Equality Human Rights Commission guidelines, and suspend Mr Shart due to the aforementioned reasons. Notwithstanding, I contend that a failure to do so may make (organisations name) ‘vicariously liable’ for any subsequent ‘omission to act’ to prevent further detriments from being inflicted upon my person. For the record, I can no longer work with Mr Shart. This is due to the very fact, that his ‘unwanted conduct’ has a ‘detrimental effect’ on my health’. As such, I ask that you consider the ‘magnitude of the risk of harm occurring, and the gravity of the harm which may occur’should management ‘refuse this request’.
It is my hope that in invoking the grievance procedure, I will not be made a workplace pariah, and or subjected to any ‘detriment’ or ‘detrimental treatment’ which would amount to a contravention of the aforementioned Acts or Regulations. I trust my career can continue to flourish under more positive circumstances, and look forward to pursuing my career with (organisations name).
1. you have used the word “danger” which is recognised under the Employment Rights Act 1996 S.44 & 100. See “
whistle-blowing
”
2. you have requested the organisation to observe EHRC guidelines. Making this request puts the burden on the employer to do so.
3. you have established that a failure to observe EHRC guidelines, or prevent any further acts being inflicted upon your person, will potentially make the employer and its directorship “
vicariously liable
” for any subsequent “
omission/s to act
“.
4. the employer cannot later argue that a failure to separate you and your harasser was an error, oversight, or simple “omission”. You have established that the employer has a duty to “act” and a failure to do so will amount to a “deliberate omission to act”.
5. By placing on the record that you no longer want to work with Mr Shart, any omission by the employer to separate the victim and harasser, may in itself amount to a discriminatory practice. (See:
Fletcher and Steele v Cannon Hygiene Ltd.
6. You have made it apparent, that should your employer subject you to a detriment for having exercising your statutory rights, could ultimately make it liable to pay you compensation.
An HR Officer who has the slightest comprehension of employment law, will find the above paragraphs very sobering. Every line of the letter of grievance contains points of law, and legal terminology, which may not be obvious to a layperson, but will be to your employer’s solicitor. You don’t want to waffle and obscure your points in pages of diatribe! Don’t give the employer any wiggle room when writing a letter of grievance. Let the employer know that you mean business, and that should it fail to remedy a breach, it is going to have to dust off its cheque book. If you need help in formulating your grievance letter, then click
here
. I can add some [case law] or [points of law] into your letter of grievance, which will beef up your letter of grievance to strengthen your case. Remember, a poorly written letter of grievance provides your employer every opportunity to rubbish what you state.
The grievance letter example above is NOT ENOUGH by itself. You have to take sufficient steps [prior] to lodging your grievance letter to both preserve and protect your own employment rights UK. Most employees will be oblivious to the fact that many employers have an ‘agreement’ with a legal organisation who will vet an employees letter of grievance to get the Company off the hook. This fundamentally undermines the Equality of Arms.
However – not all is lost
I have written a
grievance letter template
to aid employees like you with outlining the bulk of the content, which needs to be outlined within your letter of grievance, including references to Statutory Acts & Regulations. All you have to do is fill in the blanks where indicated! (

Wigan Borough Council v Davies
, [1979] ICR 411, EAT on 26th January 1979:
“There is an implied term in contracts of employment that the employer will provide reasonable support to ensure that the employee can carry out his/her duties without harassment or disruption by fellow workers; and where an employer has an obligation to take reasonable steps to achieve something and takes few or no steps, the onus of proving what steps would have been reasonable is on the employer.”
The Employment Rights Act 1996 takes into account your employment rights. Part of the Employment Rights Act 1996 also takes into account your health and safety at work. These are covered within sections [44] and [100] of the Act. The Employment Rights Act 1996 is the [Act] which governs [Employee Rights], and also forms the basis for those employee’s who want to claim either
unfair dismissal
or
constructive dismissal
in an employment tribunal. This is usually due to a
breach of the contract of employment
.
Management of Health and Safety At Work Regulations 1999. The Management of Health & Safety at Work Regulations, also known as [MHSWR 1999] is specific to
workplace risk assessments
. The MHSWR 1999 establishes your employer’s duty of care to undertake a work risk assessment for you. Your employer is obligated to [share with you] the risk assessments for your work area, and undertake risk assessments within the workplace to determine your
abilities and capabilities
to perform your respective duties. Therefore, it is incumbent upon your employer to undertake a risk assessment to [identify] what [risks] you might be exposed to whilst at work. Work risk assessments ought to include a
risk assessment for expectant mothers
, taking into account the [nature and extent] of the expectant mothers work.
Further, the Health and Safety Executive has adopted [Management Standards]. The Health and Safety Executive ‘Management Standards’ take into account [both] the employee’s workload, and the employee’s abilities and capabilities. See the section on
work related stress
, which gives a break down of the Health and Safety Executives ‘Management Standards’.
Employees in the UK lodge on average 5,000 Employment Tribunal claims every week. Therefore, there is a strong chance that you will end up being a part of this statistic. Furthermore, your employer will likely show your letter of grievance to its solicitors, in an attempt to get it off the hook. I cannot understate the importance of the letter of grievance, which you submit to your employer, and also, the steps you ought to undertake
PRIOR
to entering the grievance procedure
