Being put on a performance improvement plan.
Being made fun of.

Lack of reasonable support.
Lack of opportunities.
No advancement.
All of the above are signs and examples of a toxic workplace and toxic work environment.
My wife Amy and I are employment consultants with 26 years combined experience.
Over the last decade Amy and I have helped thousands of clients with internal employment disputes covering bullying, harassment, discrimination, unfair treatment, unfair dismissal, suspension from work, unfair capability, unfair disciplinary, being put on a performance improvement plan, being made redundant, blowing the whistle, work-related stress, sickness absence, pay, disputes with occupational health, and unfair workplace investigations.
Amy & I know firsthand the stress, anxiety, and distress, which you feel caused by working in a toxic working environment, not least because both Amy and I took our own employers to the employment tribunal. For the avoidance of doubt, we only help employees, NOT employers.
A toxic workplace leads to ill-health and ultimately being signed off from work. Thus, a toxic workplace is a ‘health and safety matter’. If you are being subjected to a toxic working environment, then reach out to Amy & I –
myrightsuk@protonmail.com
.
We can be reached during business hours (9-5) on 07775943414.
How to deal with a toxic work environment:
Unless you raise a formal grievance letter, chances are the perpetrators will continue to subject you to a toxic working environment.
My wife Amy & I can assist you in writing a grievance letter to put an end to the
bullying and harassment
, which creates the toxic work environment. We can bring your grievance letter to the points of law, and outline to your employer the fact that the toxic working environment is a health and safety matter, which is endangering your health and wellbeing at work.
In accordance with s.1(1)(a) of The HSAWA 1974, your employer has a ‘statutory duty of care’ for your health, safety, and welfare at work. Thus, if your employer has failed or is failing to have taken
reasonable steps
to have eradicated and eliminated the toxic workplace, then your employer is liable for its torts as evidenced by the case law below:
Wigan Borough Council v Davies
, [1979] ICR 411, EAT on 26th January 1979:
“There is an implied term in contracts of employment that the employer will provide reasonable support to ensure that the employee can carry out his/her duties without harassment or disruption by fellow workers; and where an employer has an obligation to take reasonable steps to achieve something and takes few or no steps, the onus of proving what steps would have been reasonable is on the employer.”
Waters (A.P.) v. Commissioner of Police For The Metropolis
[2000] 1 WLR 1607; [2000] UKHL 50; [2000] IRLR 720
“If an employer knows that acts being done by employees during their employment may cause physical or mental harm to a particular fellow employee and he does nothing to supervise or prevent such acts, when it is in his power to do so, it is clearly arguable that he may be in breach of his duty to that employee. It seems to me that he may also be in breach of that duty if he can foresee that such acts may happen and, if they do, that physical or mental harm may be caused to an individual.”
If you are concerned that raising a formal grievance letter will only aggravate the toxic working environment, then rest assured that you have the law to protect you from ‘victimization’.
Indeed, when Amy & I sued our own employers in the Employment Tribunal, we also sued the individuals who harassed and discriminated against us too.
When raising your grievance letter to your employer, we will outline your employment rights UK i.e., your statutory right to work in a working environment, which is both dignified and free from bullying and harassment.
Remember, you have every right to work in a working environment with both dignity and respect.
How to protect yourself in a toxic work environment:
We suggest keeping a diary. It is best to email yourself using your personal email address (not work email address) so that you have an electronic record of what happened, the dates the incidents happened, and the names of the perpetrators.
We usually find that the toxic workplace is created by a group of individuals who engage in what psychologists call ‘
workplace mobbing
’ rather than one particular individual.
Toxic Work Environment Complaint Letter Template:
We also suggest raising a
formal letter of grievance
to the HR Department. We suggest bringing your grievance letter to the points of law in order to ‘assert a statutory right on grounds of health and safety’. This provides your employer the opportunity to sort matters out. It also means that your employer cannot plead ignorance of the law.
You only get one chance to do this right, so we suggest reaching out to us to book in a telephone consultation so that we can discuss the workplace issues you are facing, and furthermore, how we can assist
you
moving forward. The cost of the initial consultation is only £35 up to one hour. We charge £50 an hour thereafter.
Some websites suggest talking to Human Resources or the person/s in question. However, this is rarely effective. Remember, the HR Department are there to protect your employer, not you!
Notwithstanding, raising verbal grievances affords you little protection. In order to be protected, your complaints ought to be in writing to afford you protection from victimization in accordance with the ACAS Code.
How to survive a toxic workplace:
We can help you avoid the pitfalls when complaining about a toxic work environment. You do not have to endure a toxic workplace. However, to put an end to what is happening to you, the very first thing you have to do is to take control! We can assist you in taking control and outlining your grievances under the auspices of The HSAWA 1974; The ERA 1996, and the Equality Act 2010. Please see our
testimonials page
.
